# Week 3: Influence & Technologies for Democratic Societies

### 1. Defining Influence
*   **Fundamental Definition**: Influence is the capacity to indirectly affect people's actions or beliefs.
*   **Forms**: It can be **intentional** (e.g., persuasion, advertising) or **unintentional** (e.g., expressing opinions that others monitor and adopt).

### 2. Measuring Influence: Social Media Case Study (Twitter)
A study of influence on Twitter (now X) highlighted three distinct metrics, each measuring a different type of influence:
*   **In-degree (Follower Count)**: Represents audience size but does not guarantee interaction.
*   **Retweets**: Indicates content value and "viral" reach. Retweets often bridge small accounts to larger audiences (indirect broadcast).
*   **Mentions**: Dominated by celebrities and name recognition rather than content quality.
*   **Key Insight**: High follower counts do not perfectly correlate with influence. **Engagement** is critical; users who consistently participate and act as authorities on specific topics tend to grow their influence more effectively than those who simply post frequently.

### 3. Democracy as an Influence Process
*   **The Process**: Democracy is framed as a complex influence process.
    *   **Campaigning**: The attempt to generate influence.
    *   **Voting**: A measurement point (sampling moment) where that influence is quantified.
*   **Political Incentives**: Candidates often seek office not just for public service but for power and career advancement. Gaining a lower office provides a platform/connections to campaign for higher leverage positions ("Power feeds on itself").
*   **Required Skills**: Political success relies heavily on "soft skills" like debating and networking, which differ significantly from technical skills.

### 4. Algorithmic Influence: The PageRank Algorithm (Google)
*   **Context**: Pre-Google search engines (Yahoo, AltaVista) failed to scale or provide relevant results. Google succeeded by better aligning with **user happiness** (accuracy).
*   **The Algorithm**: PageRank treats hyperlinks as "votes" of importance.
    *   **Backlinks**: If Site B links to Site A, it counts as a vote for Site A.
    *   **Recursive Weighting**: A link from a highly influential site counts more than a link from a minor site.
*   **The "Rank Sink" Problem**: Isolated cycles of websites could theoretically trap and accumulate infinite influence.
*   **The Solution (Random Surfer/Universal Tax)**: To prevent sinks, the algorithm creates a "Universal Basic Income" for the web: at each step, a small percentage of influence is taxed from every node and redistributed evenly to all nodes.

### 5. Market Dominance & Monetization
*   **Monetization**: Google succeeded where others failed by serving ads relevant to user intent (e.g., showing product ads when a user searches for a product). Users accepted this "manipulation" because it was useful.
*   **Barriers to Entry**: Competitors struggle to challenge Google due to:
    *   **Infrastructure Lead**: The sheer scale of web crawling and data storage.
    *   **Lock-in Effects**: Default placement in browsers (e.g., Firefox) ensures a constant stream of user data and revenue.

### 6. Vulnerabilities: Search Engine Manipulation
*   **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: The practice of tailoring content to rank higher. This can be benevolent (making useful information findable) or malicious.
*   **Google Bombing**: A coordinated attack where a group links a specific phrase to a target URL to manipulate the search engine's association logic.
    *   *Example*: Users coordinating to link a politician's name to an offensive definition or website.
    *   *Implication*: Algorithms that rely on "democratic" signals (links) are vulnerable to coordinated, artificial consensus.

### 7. Deep Dive: The Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME)
*   **Source**: *Epstein & Robertson (2015)* – Investigating the impact of biased search rankings on election outcomes.
*   **The Phenomenon (SEME)**: Biased search engine rankings can shift the voting preferences of **undecided voters** by **20% or more**.
    *   *Context*: This dwarfs traditional media influence (e.g., the "Fox News Effect" shifts only ~0.5% of votes).
    *   *Election Impact*: With many elections won by small margins (<3%), this invisible manipulation can decisively determine winners.
*   **Mechanism of Action**:
    *   **Trust & Primacy**: Users trust top-ranked results (relying on the efficiency of algorithms like *PageRank*, defined in Section 4) and rarely click beyond the first page.
    *   **Invisibility**: The manipulation can be **masked** (e.g., swapping one result) so users remain unaware. Crucially, even those who *detect* the bias are still influenced by it.
    *   **Digital Bandwagoning**: "Organic" ranking forces may naturally favor leading candidates, creating a feedback loop without deliberate human intervention.
*   **Democratic Threat**: Unlike the decentralized influence of campaigning (Section 3), search monopolies (Section 5) concentrate this power in a single unregulated entity, making it a unique threat to democratic integrity.
