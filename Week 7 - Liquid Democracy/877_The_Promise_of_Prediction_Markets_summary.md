## Overview

This policy forum article argues that **prediction markets**—forums for trading contracts that yield payments based on the outcome of uncertain events—are a powerful research and decision-making tool that should be freed from unnecessary government restrictions. The authors, a distinguished group of economists and scholars from major academic institutions, advocate for regulatory reform to enable these markets to flourish in the United States.

## What Are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets are trading platforms where participants buy and sell contracts whose payoffs depend on the occurrence of future events. The market price of these contracts can be interpreted as the collective probability assessment of the event occurring.

### Example: Presidential Election Contracts
A contract that pays $1 if Candidate X wins the presidential election, currently priced at 53 cents, implies the market "believes" Candidate X has a **53% chance of winning**.

### Key Principle
Prediction markets harness a fundamental economic insight: **information is widely dispersed among economic actors**, and markets provide an effective mechanism to collect and aggregate that information. The potential for profit and loss creates strong incentives for participants to seek better information.

## Evidence of Effectiveness

### Election Forecasting
Data from the **Iowa Electronic Markets** (IEM) for the 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000 presidential elections demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy:

| Timeframe | Prediction Market Error | Gallup Poll Error |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Week before election | 1.5 percentage points | 2.1 percentage points |
| 150 days before election | 5 percentage points | Much larger |

The markets consistently outperformed traditional polling methods, especially for longer-term forecasts.

### Real-World Applications
Prediction markets have been successfully implemented by:
- **U.S. Department of Defense** — for national security threat assessments
- **Healthcare industry** — for forecasting flu outbreak extent
- **Major corporations** including:
  - Eli Lilly, General Electric, Google, France Telecom
  - Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Siemens, Yahoo

These markets have been used to predict:
- Homeland security threat likelihood
- Flu outbreak severity and nationwide extent
- Success of new drug treatments
- Sales revenue from existing products
- Timing of new product launches
- Quality of recently introduced software programs

## Potential Benefits

### For Private Firms
- Improved investment decisions
- Better management of economic risks (e.g., declines in consumer demand)

### For Public Institutions
- Enhanced fiscal and monetary policy decisions
- More efficient management of social risks (e.g., flu outbreaks, environmental disasters)

### For Society
- More accurate forecasting than conventional methods
- Efficient aggregation of dispersed information
- Improved decision-making across virtually limitless applications

## Legal Impediments

The development of prediction markets in the United States faces significant regulatory barriers:

### Current Restrictions
1. **State Laws:** Eight states outright bar Internet gambling
2. **Federal Law:** The **Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (2006)** was designed to crack down on Internet gambling
3. **Regulatory Ambiguity:** These laws create doubt about the legality of prediction markets

### The Regulatory Gauntlet
To create an unambiguously legal prediction market in the United States, operators must navigate complex federal and state regulations. While prediction markets could be established outside the U.S., this approach would:
- Suppress innovation
- Reduce opportunities to aggregate information
- Limit improvements in decision-making

## Proposed Reforms

The authors propose two key steps to facilitate prediction markets while addressing regulatory concerns:

### Step 1: CFTC Safe Harbor Rules

The **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)** should establish safe harbor rules for small-stakes markets.

#### Eligible Entities for Safe Harbor Treatment:
1. **Not-for-profit research institutions** (universities, colleges, think tanks) — to operate exchanges similar to the Iowa Electronic Markets
2. **Government agencies** — for research purposes
3. **Private businesses and not-for-profits** — allowed to operate internal prediction markets with employees or contractors only

#### Key Conditions:
- **Small-stakes contracts only:** Maximum capital deposit of approximately $2,000 per participant per year
- **Not-for-profit exchanges:** May charge modest fees to cover administrative and regulatory costs
- **No brokers or paid advisers:** Reduces risk of selling to inappropriate customers or excessive fees
- **Self-regulation:** Exchanges responsible for keeping markets free from fraud and manipulation

#### Contract Scope:
The CFTC should allow contracts pricing **any economically meaningful event**, including:
- Political events
- Environmental risks
- Economic indicators

This would **exclude** contracts on sports event outcomes.

### Step 2: Congressional Support

Congress should:
1. **Support CFTC efforts** to develop prediction markets
2. **Provide necessary funding** for CFTC innovation promotion costs
3. **Explore alternative legal frameworks** if CFTC authority proves inadequate
4. **Specify preemption:** No-action letters or similar mechanisms should preempt overlapping state and federal anti-gambling laws
5. **Design regulations** so socially valuable prediction markets easily qualify for safe harbor while gambling markets do not

---

## The Path Forward

### Designing for Innovation
The CFTC should allow researchers to experiment with:
- Fee structures
- Incentives against manipulation
- Liquidity requirements
- Other design elements

This flexibility is essential because prediction markets are in an early stage of development, and experimentation is needed to identify designs that produce the most accurate predictions.

### Transparency and Informed Participation
Exchanges must inform customers about the risks and benefits of participating in these markets.

### From Small to Large Scale
While small-stakes markets necessarily limit usefulness for hedging risk, they serve as **proofs of concept** for larger-scale markets that could be developed under alternative regulatory arrangements.

---

## Conclusion

The authors advocate for **modest federal-level reforms** to facilitate prediction market development. They argue:

1. **Prediction markets have great potential** for improving social welfare across many domains
2. **American leadership** in this area would encourage parallel efforts in other countries, accelerating the development of this tool globally
3. **Regulatory barriers should be cleared away** — these barriers were never intended to inhibit socially productive innovation

> "The first step in helping prediction markets deliver on their promise is to clear away regulatory barriers that were never intended to inhibit socially productive innovation."

## Relevance to Technologies for Democratic Societies

This paper connects to broader themes in democratic technology by highlighting:

1. **Collective Intelligence:** Prediction markets harness the "wisdom of crowds" to aggregate dispersed information more effectively than traditional methods
2. **Decentralized Decision-Making:** Markets enable bottom-up information aggregation rather than top-down expert forecasting
3. **Transparency:** Market prices provide transparent, real-time probability assessments accessible to all
4. **Democratic Participation:** These markets allow broad participation in forecasting important societal outcomes
5. **Regulatory Tension:** The paper illustrates the ongoing tension between innovation and regulation in emerging democratic technologies
6. **Information Aggregation:** A key challenge in democratic societies—how to efficiently aggregate individual knowledge and preferences—is addressed through market mechanisms

## Key Takeaways

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Definition** | Trading platforms where contract prices reflect probability of future events |
| **Core Value** | Aggregates dispersed information more efficiently than traditional methods |
| **Accuracy** | Outperforms polls in election forecasting; 1.5% error vs 2.1% for Gallup |
| **Applications** | Elections, corporate planning, public health, national security |
| **Main Barrier** | Federal and state anti-gambling laws create legal uncertainty |
| **Solution Proposed** | CFTC safe harbors for small-stakes markets; Congressional support |
| **Key Insight** | Regulatory barriers intended for gambling shouldn't inhibit socially valuable prediction markets |
