## Overview
This document provides a precise summary of Quinn DuPont's chapter on "The DAO," a Decentralized Autonomous Organization launched on the Ethereum blockchain in 2016. The text combines a historical account of The DAO's rise and fall with an ethnographic study of the online discourse surrounding the event, focusing on themes of governance, authority, and distributed action.

## 1. Introduction: The Rise of The DAO
"The DAO" was an attempt to create a decentralized organization using blockchain technology and smart contracts.
- **Launch**: April 30, 2016.
- **Scale**: Raised approximately **$250 million USD** (approx. 12 million Ether, or 14% of the total ETH supply at the time) during its 28-day funding phase.
- **Goal**: To allow investors to directly fund and manage enterprises through a democratic, token-based voting system, without traditional management hierarchies.
- **Outcome**: The project was short-lived. On June 17, 2016, an exploit drained nearly 3.7 million Ether. The project was eventually disbanded, leading to a controversial "hard fork" of the Ethereum blockchain.

## 2. Visions of Decentralized Governance
The DAO was envisioned as a "direct-democracy" investment platform.
- **Mechanism**: Investors exchanged Ether for DAO tokens. These tokens granted voting rights on proposals.
- **Proposals**: Anyone could submit a proposal. Token holders voted to fund them.
- **Transparency**: All rules were encoded in smart contracts (900 lines of code), purportedly making the organization transparent, immutable, and "unstoppable."

### Major Proposals
1.  **Slock.it**: The creators of the DAO framework proposed using funds to build a "smart lock" system for the sharing economy (e.g., Airbnb access).
2.  **Other Proposals**: Included Mobotiq (electric vehicles) and Firstblood (gaming).
3.  **The DAO of Whales**: The author (DuPont) proposed an environmental charity.
    - **Concept**: A "human-whale-robot hybrid" organization.
    - **Function**: To autonomously fund research and care for a pod of orcas in the Pacific Northwest using smart contracts.
    - **Legal Theory**: Revived the medieval concept of the *deodand* (imbuing objects with legal status) to explore new forms of legal entities.

## 3. The Exploit and Collapse
Despite warnings from researchers (such as Dino Mark, Vlad Zamfir, and Emin Gün Sirer) about game-theory risks and technical bugs, The DAO proceeded.

- **The Attack (June 17, 2016)**: An unknown attacker utilized a "recursive call" bug (the "race to empty" exploit) to repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance was updated.
- **Immediate Response**:
    - **Panic**: The community and developers scrambled to stop the drain.
    - **Counter-measures**: Exchanges halted trading; "white hat" counter-attacks were launched to secure remaining funds.
- **The "Code is Law" Debate**: The attacker allegedly posted a letter claiming the action was legal because the code allowed it. This sparked a debate:
    - **Purists**: Argued "code is law"—if the code allows it, it is valid.
    - **Pragmatists**: Argued for human intervention to correct a theft.

### The Resolution: The Hard Fork
- **The Decision**: Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation supported a "hard fork"—a software upgrade that would effectively rewrite the blockchain history to return the stolen funds.
- **The Split**:
    - **Ethereum (ETH)**: The majority adopted the fork, erasing the hack.
    - **Ethereum Classic (ETC)**: A minority refused the fork on ideological grounds (immutability), continuing the original chain where the hack remained valid.

## 4. Ethnographic Themes in Governance
DuPont analyzed online discourse (primarily from Reddit, e.g., r/Ethereum) to identify three key themes regarding how algroithmic governance was imagined and enacted.

### A. Legal Authority
- **Shift in Authority**: The community envisioned a shift from *juridical authority* (state law) to *algorithmic authority* (authority vested in code).
- **Tension**: The exploit revealed the limits of algorithmic authority. When the code failed (the exploit), the community reverted to traditional social negotiation and "strong ties" to resolve the crisis.
- **Conclusion**: Algorithmic authority is not absolute; it exists on a continuum with human governance.

### B. Practical Governance
- **Governance *of* vs *by* Algorithms**:
    - **Promised**: Governance *by* algorithms (automated, decentralized rules).
    - **Observed**: Governance *of* algorithms (humans fixing code, debating hard forks).
- **Centralization Paradox**: The "hard fork" Bailout was criticized as a centralized intervention in a supposedly decentralized system, mirroring the 2008 bank bailouts.
- **Pragmatism**: The decision to fork represented "practical governance"—prioritizing the ecosystem's survival over ideological purity.

### C. Experiments in Distributed Action
- **Coordination Complexity**: Coordinating diverse actors (miners, developers, investors, exchanges) proved far more difficult than the "code is law" model assumed.
- **Incentive Failure**: Game-theoretical models (intended to align incentives) failed to account for "socially-embedded" behaviors. When the system broke, actors relied on social trust/distrust rather than improved incentives.

## 5. Conclusion
DuPont concludes that The DAO was an ambitious experiment that failed to deliver on its utopian promises of a new social order.
- **Key Insight**: The failure exposed the "social embeddedness" of technical systems. Technologies cannot easily replace centuries of refined human governance structures.
- **Legacy**: The "hard fork" and the creation of Ethereum Classic (ETC) serve as lasting reminders of the conflict between immutable code and human intent.
- **Skepticism**: The author questions whether many participants truly believed in the governance model or were simply engaging in a high-risk investment vehicle ("pump and dump").
