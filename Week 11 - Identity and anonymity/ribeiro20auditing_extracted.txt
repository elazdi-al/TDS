Figure 1: On the top row figures (a)—(e), for each community and media channels, we have the cumulative number of active
channels (that posted at least one video), of videos published, of likes, views and of comments. In the bottom row, we have
engagement metrics (accumulated over time), (figures (f), (g), (i) and (j)) and the CCDF of videos published, zoomed in the
range [40%, 100%] on the y-axis (figure (h)). Notice that for comments, we know only the year when they were published, and
thus the CDFs granularity is coarser (years rather than seconds). The raw numbers of views, likes, videos published and more
are shown in Appendix C
