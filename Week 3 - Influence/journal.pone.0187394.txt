                                                      or grant reviewers by citing prestigious publications or articles from the editor’s journal (or

                                                      enough to persuade some scholars to pad [19, 20]. Overall, it seems that many scholars con-

                                                          Most studies examining attribution manipulation focus on the existence and extent of mis-

                                                      or engineering. In addition, the pressure to acquire research funding is nearly as intense as
                                                      publication pressures and in some disciplines funding is a major component of performance

                                                      behavior is sparse [2, 6]. However, if grant distributions are swayed by manipulation then
                                                      resources are misdirected and promising areas of research could be neglected.
                                                          There is little disagreement with the sentiment that this manipulation is unethical, but there
                                                      is less agreement about how to slow its use. Ultimately, to reverse this decline of ethics we need

                                                      there are certain types of academics who add authors or citations or are coerced more often
                                                      than others. Specifically, we ask, what are the prevailing attributes of scholars who manipulate,

                                           this type of academic misconduct.

                                           Background
                                           As noted in the introduction, the primary component of performance reviews, and thus of
                                           individual research productivity, is the number of published articles by an academic [3]. This
                                           number depends on two things: (i) the number of manuscripts on which a scholar is listed as
                                           an author and (ii) the likelihood that each of those manuscripts will be published. The pressure
                                           to increase publications puts pressure on both of these components. In a general sense, this
                                           can be beneficial for society as it creates incentives for individuals to work harder (to increase
                                           the quantity of research projects) and to work better (to increase the quality of those projects)
                                           [6]. There are similar pressures and incentives in the application for, and distribution of,
                                           research grants as many disciplines in science, engineering, and medicine view the acquisition
                                           of funding as both a performance measure and a precursor to publication given the high
                                           expense of the equipment and supplies needed to conduct research [2, 6]. But this publication
                                           and funding pressure can also create perverse incentives.

                                           Honorary authorship
                                           Working harder is not the only means of increasing an academic’s number of publications. An
                                           alternative approach is known as “honorary authorship” and it specifically refers to the inclu-
                                           sion of individuals as authors on manuscripts, or grant proposals, even though they did not
                                           contribute to the research effort. Numerous studies have explored the extent of honorary
                                           authorship in a variety of disciplines [17, 20, 21–25]. The motivation to add authors can come
                                           from many sources; for instance, an author may be directed to add an individual who is a
                                           department chair, lab director, or some other administrator with power, or they might volun-
                                           tarily add such an individual to curry favor. Additionally, an author might create a reciprocal
                                           relationship where they add an honorary author to their own paper with the understanding
                                           that the beneficiary will return the favor on another paper in the future, or an author may just
                                           do a friend a favor and include their name on a manuscript [23, 24]. In addition, if the added
                                           author has a prestigious reputation, this can also increase the chances of the manuscript receiv-
                                           ing a favorable review. Through these means, individuals can raise the expected value of their
                                           measured research productivity (publications) even though their actual intellectual output is
                                           unchanged.
                                               Similar incentives apply to grant funding. Scholars who have a history of repeated funding,
                                           especially funding from the more prestigious funding agencies, are viewed favorably by their
                                           institutions [2]. Of course, grants provide resources, which increase an academic’s research
                                           output, but there are also direct benefits from funded research accruing to the university: over-
                                           head charges, equipment purchases that can be used for future projects, graduate student sup-
                                           port, etc. Consequentially, “rainmakers” (scholars with a record of acquiring significant levels
                                           of research funding) are valued for that skill.
                                               As with publications, the amount of research funding received by an individual depends on
                                           the number and size of proposals put forth and the probability of each getting funded. This
                                           metric creates incentives for individuals to get their names on more proposals, on bigger pro-
                                           posals, and to increase the likelihood that those proposals will be successful. That pressure
                                           opens the door to the same sorts of misattribution behavior found in manuscripts because
                                           honorary authorship can increase the number of grant proposals that include an author’s
                                           name and by adding a scholar with a prestigious reputation as an author they may increase
                                           their chances of being funded. As we investigate the use of honorary authorship we do not

                                           focus solely on its prevalence; we also question whether there is a systematic nature to its use.
                                           First, for example, it makes sense that academics who are early in their career have less funding
                                           and lack the protection of tenure and thus need more publications than someone with an
                                           established reputation. To begin to understand if systematic differences exist in the use of hon-
                                           orary authorship, the first set of empirical questions to be investigated here is: who is likely to
                                           add honorary authors to manuscripts or grant proposals? Scholars of lower rank and without
                                           tenure may be more likely to add authors, whether under pressure from senior colleagues or in
                                           their own attempt to sway reviewers. Tenure and promotion depend critically on a young
                                           scholars’ ability to establish a publication record, secure research funding, and engender sup-
                                           port from their senior faculty. Because they lack the protection of rank and tenure, refusing to
                                           add someone could be risky. Of course, senior faculty members also have goals and aspirations
                                           that can be challenging, but junior faculty have far more on the line in terms of their career.
                                               Second, we expect research faculty to be more likely to add honorary authors, especially to
                                           grant proposals, because they often occupy positions that are heavily dependent on a contin-
                                           ued stream of research success, particularly regarding research funding. Third, we expect that
                                           female researchers may be less able to resist pressure to add honorary authors because women
                                           are underrepresented in faculty leadership and administrative positions in academia and lack
                                           political power [26, 27]. It is not just their own lack of position that matters; the dearth of
                                           other females as senior faculty or in leadership positions leave women with fewer mentors,
                                           senior colleagues, and administrators with similar experiences to help them navigate these
                                           political minefields [28, 29]. Fourth, because adding an author waters down the credit received
                                           by each existing author, we expect manuscripts that already have several authors to be less
                                           resistant to additional “credit sharing.” Simply put, if credit is equally distributed across
                                           authors then adding a second author would cut your perceived contribution in half, but adding
                                           a sixth author reduces your contribution by only 3% (from 20% to 17%).
                                               Fifth, because academia is so competitive, the decisions of some scholars have an impact
                                           on others in the same research population. If your research interests are in an area in which
                                           honorary authorship is common and considered to be effective, then a promising counter-
                                           policy to the manipulation undertaken by others is to practice honorary authorship yourself.
                                           This leads us to predict that the obligation to add honorary authors to grant proposals and/or
                                           manuscripts is likely to concentrate more heavily in some disciplines. In other words, we do
                                           not expect it to be practiced uniformly or randomly across fields; instead, there will be some
                                           disciplines who are heavily engaged in adding authors and other disciplines less so engaged.
                                           In general, we have no firm predictions as to which disciplines are more likely to practice hon-
                                           orary authorship; we predict only that its practice will be lumpy. However, there may be rea-
                                           sons to suspect some patterns to emerge; for example, some disciplines, such as science,
                                           engineering, and medicine, are much more heavily dependent on research funding than other
                                           disciplines, such as the social sciences, mathematics, and business [2]. For example, over 70%
                                           of the NSF budget goes to science and engineering and about 4% to the social sciences. Simi-
                                           larly, most of the NIH budget goes to doctors and a smaller share to other disciplines [30].
                                           Consequently, we suspect that the disciplines that most prominently add false investigators to
                                           grant proposals are more likely to be in science, engineering, and the medical fields. We do
                                           not expect to see that division as prominent in the addition of authors to manuscripts submit-
                                           ted for publication.
                                               There are several ways scholars may internalize the pressure to perform, which can lead to
                                           different reasons why a scholar might add an honorary author to a paper. A second goal of this
                                           paper is to study who might employ these different strategies. Thus, we asked authors for the
                                           reasons they added honorary authors to their manuscripts and grants; for example, was this
                                           person in a position of authority, or a mentor, did they have a reputation that increased the

                                           chances for publication or funding, etc? Using these responses as a dependent variable, we
                                           then look to find out if these were related to the professional characteristics of the scholars in
                                           our study. The hypotheses to be tested mirror the questions posed for honorary authors. We
                                           expect junior faculty, research faculty, female faculty, and projects with more co-authors to be
                                           more likely to add additional coauthors to manuscripts and grants than professors, male fac-
                                           ulty, and projects with fewer co-authors. Moreover, we expect for the practice to differ across
                                           disciplines. Focusing specifically on honorary authorship in grant proposals, we also explore
                                           the possibility that the use of honorary authorship differs between funding opportunities and
                                           agencies.


                                           Coercive citation
                                           Journal rankings matter to editors, editorial boards, and publishers because rankings affect
                                           subscriptions and prestige. In spite of their shortcomings, impact factors have become the
                                           dominant measure of journal quality. These measures include self-citation, which creates an
                                           incentive for editors to direct authors to add citations even if those citations are irrelevant, a
                                           practice called “coercive citation” [18, 27]. This behavior has been systematically measured in
                                           business and social science disciplines [18]. Additionally, researchers have found that coercion
                                           sometimes involves more than one journal; editors have gone as far as organizing “citation car-
                                           tels” where a small set of editors recommend that authors cite articles from each other’s journal
                                           [31].
                                               When editors make decisions to coerce, who might they target, who is most likely to be
                                           coerced? Assuming editors balance the costs and benefits of their decisions, a parallel set of
                                           empirical hypotheses emerge. Returning to the various scholar attributes, we expect editors to
                                           target lower-ranked faculty members because they may have a greater incentive to cooperate
                                           as additional publications have a direct effect on their future cases for promotion, and for assis-
                                           tant professors on their chances of tenure as well. In addition, because they have less political
                                           clout and are less likely to openly complain about coercive treatment, lower ranked faculty
                                           members are more likely to acquiesce to the editor’s request. We predict that editors are more
                                           likely to target female scholars because female scholars hold fewer positions of authority in aca-
                                           demia and may lack the institutional support of their male counterparts. We also expect the
                                           number of coauthors to play a role, but contrary to our honorary authorship prediction, we
                                           predict editors will target manuscripts with fewer authors rather than more authors. The ratio-
                                           nale is simple; authors do not like to be coerced and when an editor requires additional cita-
                                           tions on a manuscript having many authors then the editor is making a larger number of
                                           individuals aware of their coercive behavior, but coercing a sole-authored paper upsets a single
                                           individual. Notice that we are hypothesizing the opposite sign in this model than in the honor-
                                           ary authorship model; if authors are making a decision to add honorary authors then they pre-
                                           fer to add people to articles that already have many co-authors, but if editors are making the
                                           decision then they prefer to target manuscripts with few authors to minimize the potential
                                           pushback.
                                               As was true in the model of honorary authorship, we expect the practice of coercion to be
                                           more prevalent in some disciplines than others. If one editor decides to coerce authors and if
                                           that strategy is effective, or is perceived to be effective, then there is increased pressure for
                                           other editors in the same discipline to also coerce just to maintain their ranking—if one jour-
                                           nal climbs up in the rankings, others, who do nothing, fall. Consequently, coercion begets
                                           additional coercion and the practice can spread. But, a journal climbing up in the rankings in
                                           one discipline has little impact on other disciplines and thus we expect to find coercion prac-
                                           ticed unevenly; prevalent in some disciplines, less so in others. Finally, as a sub-conjecture to

                                           this hypothesis, we expect coercive citation to be more prevalent in disciplines for which jour-
                                           nal publication is the dominant measure for promotion and tenure; that is, disciplines that rely
                                           less heavily on grant funding. This means we expect the practice to be scattered, and lumpy,
                                           but we also expect relatively more coercion in the business and social sciences disciplines.
                                              We are also interested in the types of journals that have been reported to coerce and to
                                           explore those issues we gather data using the journal as the unit of observation. As above, we
                                           expect differences between disciplines and we expect those discipline differences to mirror the
                                           discipline differences found in the author-based data set. We also expect a relationship
                                           between journal ranking and coercion because the costs and benefits of coercion differ for
                                           more or less prestigious journals. Consider the benefits of coercion. The very highest ranked
                                           journals have high impact factors; consequently, to rise another position in the rankings
                                           requires a significant increase in citations, which would require a lot of coercion. Lower-
                                           ranked journals, however, might move up several positions with relatively few coerced cita-
                                           tions. Furthermore, consider the cost of coercion. Elite journals possess valuable reputations
                                           and risking them by coercing might be foolhardy; journals deep down in the rankings have
                                           less at stake. Given this logic, it seems likely that lower ranked journals are more likely to have
                                           practiced coercion.
                                              We also look to see if publishers might influence the coercive decision. Journals are owned
                                           and published by many different types of organizations; the most common being commercial
                                           publishers, academic associations, and universities. A priori, commercial publishers, being
                                           motivated by profits, are expected to be more interested in subscriptions and sales, so the
                                           return to coercion might be higher for that group. On the other hand, the integrity of a journal
                                           might be of greater concern to non-profit academic associations and university publishers, but
                                           we don’t see a compelling reason to suppose that universities or academic associations will
                                           behave differently from one another. Finally, we control for some structural difference across
                                           journals by including each journal’s average number of cites per document and the total num-
                                           ber of documents they publish per year.


                                           Padded citations
                                           The third and final type of attribution manipulation explored here is padded reference lists.
                                           Because some editors coerce scholars to add citations to boost their journals’ impact factor
                                           score and because this practice is known by many scholars there is an incentive for scholars
                                           to add superfluous citations to their manuscripts prior to submission [18]. Provided there is
                                           an incentive for scholars to pad their reference lists in manuscripts, we wondered if grant
                                           writers would be willing to pad reference lists in grants in an attempt to influence grant
                                           reviewers.
                                               As with honorary authorship, we suspect there may be a systematic element to padding
                                           citations. In fact, we expect the behavior of padding citations to parallel the honorary author
                                           behavior. Thus we predict that scholars of lower rank and therefore without tenure and female
                                           scholars to be more likely to pad citations to assuage an editor or sway grant reviewers. Because
                                           the practice also encompasses a feedback loop (one way to compete with scholars who pad
                                           their citations is to pad your citations) we expect the practice to proliferate in some disciplines.
                                           The number of coauthors is not expected to play a role, but we also expect knowledge of other
                                           types of manipulation to be important. That is, we hypothesize that individuals who are aware
                                           of coercion, or who have been coerced, are more likely to pad citations. With grants, we simi-
                                           larly expect individuals who add honorary authors to grant proposals to also be likely to pad
                                           citations in grant proposals. Essentially, the willingness to misbehave in one area is likely
                                           related to misbehavior in other areas.

                                                    Methods
                                                    The data collection method of choice for this study is survey because to it would be difficult to
                                                    determine if someone added honorary authors or padded citations prior to submission with-
                                                    out asking that individual. As explained below, we distributed surveys in four waves over five
                                                    years. Each survey, its cover email, and distribution strategy was reviewed and approved by the
                                                    University of Alabama in Huntsville’s Institutional Review Board. Copies of these approvals
                                                    are available on request. We purposely did not collect data that would allow us to identify indi-
                                                    vidual respondents. We test our hypotheses using these survey data and journal data. Given
                                                    the complexity of the data collection, both survey and archival journal data, we will begin with
                                                    discussing our survey data and the variables developed from our survey. We then discuss our
                                                    journal data and the variables developed there. Over the course of a five-year period and using
                                                    four waves of survey collection, we sent surveys, via email, to more than 110,000 scholars in
                                                    total from eighteen different disciplines (medicine, nursing, biology, chemistry, computer sci-

Four waves of surveys were sent to these 18 disciplines over a five year period. First wave (shaded orange) focused on coercive citation in business and the
social sciences. Some of these data were used in a published study on coercive citation [18]. Second wave (pink) was early in the spring of 2012 and
surveyed the health care disciplines. Third wave (green) was distributed in the fall of 2012 and asked about honorary authorship in STEM disciplines and the
social sciences. The fourth wave (shaded blue) filled in the rest of the data; collecting honorary authorship data from business and coercive citation data
from the sciences.

                                               Potential survey recipients and their contact information (email addresses) were identified
                                           in three different ways. First, we were able to get contact information for management scholars
                                           through the Academy Management using the annual meeting catalog. Second, for economics
                                           and physicians we used the membership services provided by the American Economic Associ-
                                           ation and the American Medical Association. Third, for the remaining disciplines we identi-
                                           fied the top 200 universities in the United States using U.S. News and World Report’s “National
                                           University Rankings” and hand-collected email addresses by visiting those university websites
                                           and copying contact information for individual faculty members from each of the disciplines.
                                           We also augmented the physician contact list by visiting the web sites of the medical schools
                                           in these top 200 school as well. With each wave of surveys, we sent at least one reminder to par-
                                           ticipate. The approximately 110,000 surveys yielded about 12,000 responses for an overall
                                           response rate of about 10.5%. Response rates by discipline can be found in Table A in S1
                                           Appendix.
                                               Few studies have examined the systematic nature of honorary authorship and padded cita-
                                           tion and thus we developed our own survey items to address our hypotheses. Our survey items
                                           for coercive citation were taken from prior research on coercion [18]. All survey items and the
                                           response alternatives with raw data counts are given in S1 Appendix. The complete data are

                                               Our first set of tests relate to honorary authorship in manuscripts and grants and is made
                                           up of several dependent variables, each related to the research question being addressed. We
                                           begin with the existence of honorary authorship in manuscripts. This dependent variable is
                                           composed of the answers to the survey question: “Have YOU felt obligated to add the name
                                           of another individual as a coauthor to your manuscript even though that individual’s contri-
                                           bution was minimal?” Responses were in the form of yes and no where “yes” was coded as a 1
                                           and “no” coded as a 0. The next dependent variable addresses the frequency of this behavior
                                           asking: “In the last five years HOW MANY TIMES have you added or had coauthors added
                                           to your manuscripts even though they contributed little to the study?” The final honorary
                                           authorship dependent variables deal with the reason for including an honorary author in
                                           manuscripts: “Even though this individual added little to this manuscript he (or she) was
                                           included as an author. The main reason for this inclusion was:” and the choices regarding
                                           this answer were that the honorary author is the director of the lab or facility used in the
                                           research, occupies a position of authority and can influence my career, is my mentor, is a col-
                                           league I wanted to help out, was included for reciprocity (I was included or expect to be
                                           included as a co-author on their work), has data I needed, has a reputation that increases the
                                           chances of the work being published, or they had funding we could apply to the research.
                                           Responses were coded as 1 for the main reason given (only one reason could be selected as
                                           the “main” reason) and 0 otherwise.
                                               Regarding honorary authorship in grant proposals, our first dependent variable addresses
                                           its existence: “Have you ever felt obligated to add a scholar’s name to a grant proposal even
                                           though you knew that individual would not make a significant contribution to the research
                                           effort?” Again, responses were in the form of yes and no where “yes” was coded as a 1 and “no”
                                           coded as a 0. The remaining dependent variables regarding honorary authorship in grant pro-
                                           posals addresses the reasons for adding honorary authors to proposals: “The main reason you
                                           added an individual to this grant proposal even though he (or she) was not expected to make a
                                           significant contribution was:” and the provided potential responses were that the honorary
                                           author is the director of the lab or facility used in the research, occupies a position of authority
                                           and can influence my career, is my mentor, is a colleague I wanted to help out, was included
                                           for reciprocity (I was included or expect to be included as a co-author on their work), has data
                                           I needed, has a reputation that increases the chances of the work being published, or was a

                                           person suggested by the grant reviewers. Responses were coded as 1 for the main reason given
                                           (only one reason could be selected as the “main” reason) and 0 otherwise.
                                               Our next major set of dependent variables deal with coercive citation. The first coercive
                                           citation dependent variable was measured using the survey question: “Have YOU received a
                                           request from an editor to add citations from the editor’s journal for reasons that were not
                                           based on content?” Responses were in the form of yes (coded as a 1) and no (coded as 0). The
                                           next question deals with the frequency: “In the last five years, approximately HOW MANY
                                           TIMES have you received a request from the editor to add more citations from the editor’s
                                           journal for reasons that were not based on content?”
                                               Our final set of dependent variables from our survey data investigates padding citations in
                                           manuscripts and grants. The dependent variable that addresses an author’s willingness to pad
                                           citations for manuscripts comes from the following question: “If I were submitting an article
                                           to a journal with a reputation of asking for citations to itself even if those citations are not criti-
                                           cal to the content of the article, I would probably add such citations BEFORE SUBMISSION.”
                                           Answers to this question were in the form of a Likert scale with five potential responses
                                           (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, and Strongly Agree) where Strongly Disagree
                                           was coded as a 1 and Strongly Agree coded as a 5. The dependent variable for padding cita-
                                           tions in grant proposals uses responses to the statement: “When developing a grant proposal I
                                           tend to skew my citations toward high impact factor journals, even if those citations are of
                                           marginal import to my proposal.” Answers were in the form of a Likert scale with five poten-
                                           tial responses (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, and Strongly Agree) where
                                           Strongly Disagree was coded as a 1 and Strongly Agree coded as a 5.
                                               To test our research questions, several independent variables were developed. We begin by
                                           addressing the independent variables that cut across honorary authorship, coercive citation,
                                           and padding citations. The first is academic rank. We asked respondents their current rank:
                                           Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, Research Faculty, Clinical Faculty, and
                                           other. Dummy variables were created for each category with Professor being the omitted cate-
                                           gory in our tests of the hypotheses. The second general independent variable is discipline:
                                           Medicine, Nursing, Accounting, Economics, Finance, Information Systems, Management,
                                           Marketing, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science,
                                           Ecology, and Engineering. Again, dummy variables were created for each discipline, but
                                           instead of omitting a reference category we include all disciplines and then constrain the sum
                                           of their coefficients to equal zero. With this approach, the estimated coefficients then tell us
                                           how each discipline differs from the average level of honorary authorship, coercive citation, or
                                           padded citation across the academic spectrum [32]. We can conveniently identify three catego-
                                           ries: (i) disciplines that are significantly more likely to engage in honorary authorship, coercive
                                           citation, or padded citation than the average across all disciplines, (ii) disciplines that do not
                                           differ significantly from the average level of honorary authorship, coercive citation, or padded
                                           citation across all of these disciplines, and (iii) those who are significantly less likely to engage
                                           in honorary authorship, coercive citation, or padded citation than the average. We test the
                                           potential gender differences with a dummy variable male = 1, females = 0.
                                               Additional independent variables were developed for specific research questions. In our
                                           tests of honorary authorship, there is an independent variable addressing the number of co-
                                           authors on a respondent’s most recent manuscript. If the respondent stated that they have
                                           added an honorary author then they were asked “Please focus on the most recent incidence in
                                           which an individual was added as a coauthor to one of your manuscripts even though his or
                                           her contribution was minimal. Including yourself, how many authors were on this manu-
                                           script?” Respondents who had not added an honorary author were asked to report the number
                                           of authors on their most recently accepted manuscript. We also include an independent

                                           variable regarding funding agencies: “To which agency, organization, or foundation was this
                                           proposal directed?” Again, for those who have added authors, we request they focus on the
                                           most recent proposal where they used honorary authorship and for those who responded that
                                           they have not practiced honorary authorship, we asked where they sent their most recent pro-
                                           posal. Their responses include NSF, HHS, Corporations, Private nonprofit, State funding,
                                           Other Federal grants, and Other grants. Regarding coercive citation, we included an indepen-
                                           dent variable regarding number of co-authors on their most recent coercive experience and
                                           thus if a respondent indicated they’ve been coerced we asked: “Please focus on the most recent
                                           incident in which an editor asked you to add citations not based on content. Including your-
                                           self, how many authors were on this manuscript?” If a respondent indicated they’ve never
                                           been coerced, we asked them to state the number of authors on their most recently accepted
                                           manuscript.
                                               Finally, we included control variables. In our tests, we included the respondent’s perfor-
                                           mance or exposure to these behaviors. For those analyses focusing on manuscripts we used
                                           acceptances: “Within the last five years, approximately how many publications, including
                                           acceptances, do you have?” The more someone publishes, the more opportunities they have to
                                           be coerced, add authors, or add citations; thus, scholars who have published more articles are
                                           more likely to have experienced coercion, ceteris paribus. And in our tests of grants we used
                                           two performance indicators: 1) “In the last five years approximately how many grant proposals
                                           have you submitted for funding?” and 2) “Approximately how much grant money have you
                                           received in the last five years? Please write your estimated dollars in box; enter 0 if zero.”
                                               We also investigate coercion using a journal-based dataset, Scopus, which contains infor-
                                           mation on more than 16,000 journals from these 18 disciplines [33]. It includes information
                                           on the number of articles published each year, the average number of citations per manuscript,
                                           the rank of the journal, disciplines that most frequently publish in the journal, the publisher,
                                           and so forth. These data were used to help develop our dependent variable as well as our inde-
                                           pendent and control variables for the journal analysis. Our raw journal data is provided in S4
                                           Appendix: Journal data.
                                               The dependent variables in our journal analysis measure whether a specific journal was
                                           identified as a journal in which coercion occurred, or not, and the frequency of that identifica-
                                           tion. Survey respondents were asked: “To track the possible spread of this practice we need to
                                           know specific journals. Would you please provide the names of journals you know engage in
                                           this practice?” Respondents were given a blank space to write in journal names. The majority
                                           of our respondents declined to identify journals where coercion has occurred; however, more
                                           than 1200 respondents provided journal names and in some instances, respondents provided
                                           more than one journal name. Among the population of journals in the Scopus database, 612 of
                                           these were identified as journals that have coerced by our survey respondents, some of these
                                           journals were identified several times. The first dependent variable is binary, coded as 1 if a
                                           journal was identified as a journal that has coerced, and coded as 0 otherwise. The frequency
                                           estimates uses the count, how many times they were named, as the dependent variable.
                                               The independent variables measure various journal attributes, the first being discipline.
                                           The Scopus database identifies the discipline that most frequently publishes in any given jour-
                                           nal, and that information was used to classify journals by discipline. Thus, if physics is the
                                           most common discipline to publish in a journal, it was classified as a physics journal. We look
                                           to see if there is a publisher effect using the publisher information in Scopus to create four cate-
                                           gories: commercial publishers, academic associations, universities, and others (the omitted ref-

                                               We also control for differing editorial norms across disciplines. First, we include the num-

                                           number of citations per article. The average number of citations per document controls for

                                           Honorary authorship in research manuscripts
                                           Looking across all disciplines, 35.5% of our survey respondents report that they have added an
                                           author to a manuscript even though the contribution of those authors was minimal. Fig 1 dis-
                                           plays tallies of some raw responses to show how the use of honorary authorship, for both man-
                                           uscripts and grants, differs across science, engineering, medicine, business, and the social
                                           sciences.
                                              To begin the empirical study of the systematic use of honorary authorship, we start with the
                                           addition of honorary authors to research manuscripts. This is a logit model in which the
                                           dependent variable equals one if the respondent felt obligated to add an author to their manu-
                                           script, “even though that individual’s contribution was minimal.” The estimates appear in
                                           Table 3. In brief, all of our conjectures are observed in these data. As we hypothesized above,
                                           the pressure on scholars to add authors “who do not add substantially to the research project,”
                                           is more likely to be felt by assistant professors and associate professors relative to professors
                                           (the reference category). To understand the size of the effect, we calculate odds ratios (eβ) for
                                           each variable, also reported in Table 3. Relative to a full professor, being an assistant professor
                                           increases the odds of honorary authorship in manuscripts by 90%, being an associate professor
                                           increases those odds by 40%, and research faculty are twice as likely as a professor to add an
                                           honorary author.
                                              Consistent with our hypothesis, we found support that females were more likely to add
                                           honorary authors as the estimated coefficient on males was negative and statistically signifi-
                                           cant. The odds that a male feels obligated to add an author to a manuscript is 38% lower than
                                           for females. As hypothesized, authors who already have several co-authors on a manuscript
                                           seem more willing to add another; consistent with our hypotheses that the decrement in indi-
                                           vidual credit diminishes as the number of authors rises. Overall, these results align with our
                                           fundamental thesis that authors are purposively deciding to deceive, adding authors when the
                                           benefits are higher and the costs lower.
                                              Considering the addition of honorary authors to manuscripts, Table 3 shows that four disci-
                                           plines are statistically more likely to add honorary authors than the average across all disci-
                                           plines. Listing those disciplines in order of their odds ratios and starting with the greatest
                                           odds, they are: marketing, management, ecology, and medicine (physicians). There are five
                                           disciplines in which honorary authorship is statistically below the average and starting with
                                           the lowest odds ratio they are: political science, accounting, mathematics, chemistry, and eco-
                                           nomics. Finally, the remaining disciplines, statistically indistinguishable from the average, are:
                                           physics, psychology, sociology, computer science, finance, engineering, biology, information
                                           systems, and nursing. At the extremes, scholars in marketing are 75% more likely to feel an
                                           obligation to add authors to a manuscript than the average across all disciplines while political
                                           scientists are 44% less likely than the average to add an honorary author to a manuscript.

                                              To bolster these results, we also asked individuals to tell us how many times they felt obli-
                                           gated to add honorary authors to manuscripts in the last five years. Using these responses as
                                           our dependent variable we estimated a negative binomial regression equation with the same
                                           independent variables used in Table 3. The estimated coefficients and their transformation
                                           into incidence rate ratios are given in Table 4. Most of the estimated coefficients in Tables 3
                                           and 4 have the same sign and, with minor differences, similar significance levels, which sug-
                                           gests the attributes associated with a higher likelihood of adding authors are also related to the
                                           frequency of that activity. Looking at the incidence rate ratios in Table 4, scholars occupying
                                           the lower academic ranks, research professors, females, and manuscripts that already have
                                           many authors more frequently add authors. Table 4 also suggests that three additional disci-
                                           plines, Nursing, Biology, and Engineering, have more incidents of adding honorary authors to
                                           manuscripts than the average of all disciplines and, consequently, the disciplines that most fre-
                                           quently engage in honorary authorship are, by effect size, management, marketing, ecology,
                                           engineering, nursing, biology, and medicine.
                                              Another way to measure effect sizes is to standardize the variables so that the changes in the
                                           odds ratios or incidence rate ratios measure the impact of a one standard deviation change of
                                           the independent variable on the dependent variable. In Tables 3 and 4, the continuous vari-
                                           ables are the number of coauthors on the particular manuscripts of interest and the number of
                                           publications of each respondent. Tables C and D (in S1 Appendix) show the estimated coeffi-
                                           cients and odds ratios with standardized coefficients. Comparing the two sets of results is
                                           instructive. In Table 3, the odds ratio for the number of coauthors is 1.035, adding each addi-
                                           tional author increases the odds of this manuscript having an honorary author by 3.5%. The
                                           estimated odds ratio for the standardized coefficient, (Table C in S1 Appendix) is 1.10, mean-
                                           ing an increase in the number of coauthors of one standard deviation increases the odds that
                                           this manuscript has an honorary author by 10%. Meanwhile the standard deviation of the
                                           number of coauthors in this sample is 2.78, so 3.5% x 2.78 = 9.73%; the two estimates are very
                                           similar. This similarity repeats itself when we consider the number of publications and when
                                           we compare the incidence rate ratios across Table 4 and Table D in S1 Appendix. Standardiza-
                                           tion also tells us something about the relative effect size of different independent variables and
                                           in both models a standard deviation increase in the number of coauthors has a larger impact

Negative binomial regression, the dependent variable is the number of times the respondent added honorary authors to manuscripts in the last five years.
Independent variables include academic ranks, disciplines, gender, number of co-authors, and the number of publications. Discipline estimates compare
each discipline to the overall average across all disciplines.
* Indicates significance at the 5% level;
** significant at the 1% level.

                                                          The results appear in Table 5 and, again, we see significant participation in honorary
                                                      authorship. The estimates largely follow our predictions and mirror the results of the models
                                                      in Tables 3 and 4. Academic rank has a smaller effect, being an assistant professor increases
                                                      the odds of adding an honorary author to a grant by 68% and being an associate professor
                                                      increases those odds by 52%. On the other hand, the impact of being a research professor is
                                                      larger in the grant proposal models than the manuscripts model of Table 3 while the impact of
                                                      sex is smaller. As was true in the manuscripts models, the obligation to add honorary authors
                                                      is also lumpy, some disciplines being much more likely to engage in the practice than others.
                                                      We find five disciplines in the “more likely than average” category: medicine, nursing,

                                           management, engineering, and psychology. The disciplines that tend to add fewer honorary
                                           authors to grants are political science, biology, chemistry, and physics. Those that are indistin-
                                           guishable from the average are accounting, economics, finance, information systems, sociol-
                                           ogy, ecology, marketing, computer science, and mathematics.
                                               We speculated that science, engineering, and medicine were more likely to practice honor-
                                           ary authorship in grant proposals because those disciplines are more dependent on research
                                           funding and more likely to consider funding as a requirement for tenure and promotion. The
                                           results in Tables 3 and 5 are somewhat consistent with this conjecture. Of the five disciplines
                                           in the “above average” category for adding honorary authors to grant proposals, four (medi-
                                           cine, nursing, engineering, and psychology) are dependent on labs and funding to build and
                                           maintain such labs for their research.


                                           Reasons for adding honorary authors
                                           Our next set of results looks more deeply into the reasons scholars give for adding honorary
                                           authors to manuscripts and to grants. When considering honorary authors added to manu-
                                           scripts, we focus on a set of responses to the question: “what was the major reason you felt
                                           you needed to add those co-author(s)?” When we look at grant proposals, we use responses
                                           to the survey question: “The main reason you added an individual to this grant proposal even
                                           though he (or she) was not expected to make a significant contribution was. . .” Starting with
                                           manuscripts, although nine different reasons for adding authors were cited (see survey in S1
                                           Appendix), only three were cited more than 10% of the time. The most common reason
                                           our respondents added honorary authors (28.4% of these responses) was because the added
                                           individual was the director of the lab. The second most common reason (21.4% of these
                                           responses), and the most disturbing, was that the added individual was in a position of
                                           authority and could affect the scholar’s career. Third among the reasons for honorary author-
                                           ship (13.2%) were mentors. “Other” was selected by about 13% of respondents. The percent-
                                           age of raw responses for each reason is shown in Fig 2.
                                               To find out if the three most common responses were related to the professional character-
                                           istics of the scholars in our study, we re-estimate the model in Table 3 after replacing the

                                           or a grant proposal. Director refers to responses stating, “this individual was the director of the lab or facility
                                           used in the research.” Authority refers to responses stating, “this individual occupies a position of authority
                                           and can influence my career.” Mentor, “this is my mentor”; colleague, “this a colleague I wanted to help”;
                                           reciprocity, “I was included or expect to be included as a co-author on their work”; data, “they had data I
                                           needed”; reputation, “their reputation increases the chances of the work being published (or funded)”; funding,
                                           “they had funding we could apply to the research”; and reviewers, “the grant reviewers suggested we add co-
                                           authors.”

Logit regression, dependent variable is binary: 1 = added director of laboratory as co-author, or someone in position of authority, or a mentor (even though
they were not materially involved in the research), 0 = some other reason for adding author. Independent variables include academic ranks, disciplines,
gender, number of co-authors, and number of publications in last five years.
* Indicates significance at the 5% level;

                                                      played in Table 6, under the heading “Director of Laboratory,” estimates a regression in which
                                                      the dependent variable equals one if the respondent added the director of the research lab in
                                                      which they worked as an honorary author and equals zero if this was not the reason. The sec-

                                           in S1 Appendix, Table E. Note the sample size is smaller for these regressions because we
                                           include only those respondents who say they have added a superfluous author to a manuscript.
                                               The results are as expected. The individuals who are more likely to add a director of a labo-
                                           ratory are research faculty (they mostly work in research labs and centers), and scholars in
                                           fields in which laboratory work is a primary method of conducting research (medicine, nurs-
                                           ing, psychology, biology, chemistry, ecology, and engineering). The second model suggests
                                           that the scholars who add an author because they feel pressure from individuals in a position
                                           of authority are junior faculty (assistant and associate professors, and research faculty) and
                                           individuals in medicine, nursing, and management. The third model suggests assistant pro-
                                           fessors, lecturers, research faculty, and clinical faculty are more likely to add their mentors as
                                           an honorary author. Since many mentorships are established in graduate school or through
                                           post-docs, it is sensible that scholars who are early in their career still feel an obligation to
                                           their mentors and are more likely to add them to manuscripts. Finally, the disciplines most
                                           likely to add mentors to manuscripts seem to be the “professional” disciplines: medicine,
                                           nursing, and business (economics, information systems, management, and marketing). We
                                           do not report the results for the other five reasons for adding honorary authors because few
                                           respondent characteristics were statistically significant. One explanation for this lack of sig-
                                           nificance may be the smaller sample size (less than 10% of the respondents indicated one of
                                           these remaining reasons as being the primary reason they added an author) or it may be that
                                           even if these rationales are relatively common, they might be distributed randomly across
                                           ranks and disciplines.
                                               Turning to grant proposals, the dominant reason for adding authors to grant proposals
                                           even though they are not actually involved in the research was reputation. Of the more than
                                           2100 individuals who gave a specific answer to this question, 60.8% selected “this individual
                                           had a reputation that increases the chances of the work being funded.” The second most fre-
                                           quently reported reason for grants was that the added individual was the director of the lab
                                           (13.5%), and third was people holding a position of authority (13%). All other reasons gar-
                                           nered a small number of responses.
                                               We estimate a set of regressions similar to Table 6 using the reasons for honorary grant pro-
                                           posal authorship as the dependent variable and the independent variables from the grant pro-
                                           posal models of Table 5. Before estimating those models we also add six dummy variables
                                           reflecting different sources of research funding to see if the reason for adding honorary cita-
                                           tions differs by type of funding. These dummy variables indicate funding from NSF, HHS
                                           (which includes the NIH), research grants from private corporations, grants from private,
                                           non-profit organizations, state research grants, and then a variable capturing all other federally
                                           funded grants. The omitted category is all other grants. The estimated coefficients appear in
                                           Table 7 and the odds ratios are reported in Table F in S1 Appendix.
                                               The first column of results in Table 7 replicates and adds to the model in Table 5, in which
                                           the dependent variable is: “have you added honorary authors to grant proposals.” The reason
                                           we replicate that model is to add the six funding sources to the regression to see if some agen-
                                           cies see more honorary authors in their proposals than other agencies. The results in Table 7
                                           suggest they do. Federally funded grants are more likely to have honorary authorships than
                                           other sources of grant funding as the coefficients on NSF, NIH, and other federal funding are
                                           all positive and significant at the 0.01 level. Corporate research grants also tend to have honor-
                                           ary authors included.
                                               The remaining columns in Table 7 suggest that scholars in medicine and management are
                                           more likely to add honorary authors to grant proposals because of the added scholar’s reputa-
                                           tion, but there is little statistical difference across the other characteristics of our respondents.

Logit regression, dependent variable is binary: 1 = added an author to a grant proposal because of his or reputation, or added the director of laboratory as
co-author, or someone in position of authority (even though they were not materially involved in the research), 0 = some other reason for adding author.
Independent variables include academic ranks, disciplines, gender, funding agency, number of grants, and total grand funding received in last five years.
* Indicates significance at the 5% level;

                                                     is more likely to be practiced with grants to the Department of Health and Human Services
                                                     (probably because of the heavy presence of medical proposals and honorary authorship is
                                                     common in medicine) and it is statistically less likely to be used in grant proposals directed
                                                     towards corporate research funding.

                                               Table 7 shows that lab directors tend to be honorary authors in grant proposals with assis-
                                           tant professors and for grant proposals directed to private corporations. While position of
                                           authority (i.e., political power) was the third most frequently cited reason to add someone to a
                                           proposal, its practice seems to be dispersed across the academic universe as the regression
                                           results in Table 7 do not show much variation across rank, discipline, their past experience
                                           with research funding, or the funding source to which the proposal was directed. The remain-
                                           ing reasons for adding authors garnered a small portion of the total responses and there was
                                           little significant variation across the characteristics measured here. For these reasons, their
                                           regression results are not reported.

                                           Coercive citations
                                           There is widespread distaste among academics concerning the use of coercive citation. Over
                                           90% of our respondents view coercion as inappropriate, 85.3% think its practice reduces the
                                           prestige of the journal, and 73.9% are less likely to submit work to a journal that coerces. These
                                           opinions are shared across the academic spectrum as shown in Fig 3, which breaks out these
                                           responses by the major fields, medicine, science, engineering, business, and the social sciences.
                                           Despite this disapproval, 14.1% of the overall respondents report being coerced. Similar to the
                                           analyses above, our task is to see if there is a systematic set of attributes of scholars who are
                                           coerced or if there are attributes of journals that are related to coercion.
                                               Two dependent variables are used to measure the existence and the frequency of coercive
                                           citation. The first is a binary dependent variable, whether respondents were coerced or not,
                                           and the second counts the frequency of coercion, asking our respondents how many times they
                                           have been coerced in the last five years. Table 8 presents estimates of the logit model (coerced
                                           or not) and their odds ratios and Table 9 presents estimates of the negative binomial model
                                           (measuring the frequency of coercion) and their accompanying incident rate ratios. With but
                                           a single exception (the estimated coefficient on female scholars was opposite our expectation)
                                           our hypotheses are supported. In this sample, it is males who are more likely to be coerced, the
                                           effect size estimates that being a male raises the odds ratio of being coerced by 18%. In the fre-
                                           quency estimates in Table 9, however, there was no statistical difference between male and
                                           female scholars.

                                           presents the percentage of respondents from each major academic group who either strongly agree or agree
                                           with the statement the coercive citations, “is inappropriate.” The second column is the percentage that agrees
                                           to, “[it] reduces the prestige of the journal.” The third column reflects agreement to, “are less likely to submit
                                           work to a journal that coerces.”

                                                         Consistent with our hypotheses, assistant professors and associate professors were more
                                                      likely to be coerced than full professors and the effect was larger for assistant professors. Being

                                                      while associate professors see about half of that, a 21% increase in their odds. Table 9 shows
                                                      assistant professors are also coerced more frequently than professors. Co-authors had a nega-

                                           emerges in the frequency model. In the S1 Appendix, these models are re-estimated after stan-
                                           dardizing the continuous variables. Results appear in Table G (existence of coercion) and
                                           Table H (frequency of coercion.)


                                           Coercive citations: Journal data
                                           To achieve a deeper understanding of coercive citation, we reexamine this behavior using aca-
                                           demic journals as our unit of observation. We analyze these journal-based data in two ways: 1)
                                           a logit model in which the dependent variable equals 1 if that journal was named as having
                                           coerced and 0 if not and 2) a negative binomial model where the dependent variable is the
                                           count of the number of times a journal was identified as one where coercion occurred. As
                                           before, the variance of these data substantially exceeds the mean and thus Poison regression is
                                           inappropriate. To test our hypotheses, our included independent variables are the dummy var-
                                           iables for discipline, journal rank, and dummy variables for different types of publishers. We
                                           control for some of the different editorial practices across journals by including the number of
                                           documents published annually by each journal and the average number of citations per article.
                                               The results of the journal-based analysis appear in Table 10. Once again, and consistent
                                           with our hypothesis, the differences across disciplines emerge and closely follow the previous
                                           results. The discipline journals most likely to have coerced authors for citations are in business.
                                           The effect of a journal’s rank on its use of coercion is perhaps the most startling finding. Mea-
                                           suring journal rank using the h-index suggests that more highly rated journals are more likely
                                           to have coerced and coerced more frequently, which is opposite our hypothesis that lower
                                           ranked journals are more likely to coerce. Perhaps the chance to move from being a “good”
                                           journal to a “very good” journal is just too tempting to pass. There is some anecdotal evidence
                                           that is consistent with this result. If one surfs through the websites of journals, many simply do
                                           not mention their rank or impact factor. However, those that do mention their rank or impact
                                           tend to be more highly ranked journals (a low-ranked journal typically doesn’t advertise that
                                           fact), but the very presence of the impact factor on a website suggests that the journal, or more
                                           importantly the publisher, places some value on it and, given that pressure, it is not surprising
                                           to find that it may influence editorial decisions. On the other hand, we might be observing the
                                           results of established behavior. If some journals have practiced coercion for an extended time
                                           then their citation count might be high enough to have inflated their h-index. We cannot dis-
                                           cern a direction of causality, but either way our results suggest that more highly ranked jour-
                                           nals end up using coercion more aggressively, all else equal.
                                               There seems to be publisher effects as well. As predicted, journals published by private,
                                           profit oriented companies are more likely to be journals that have coerced, but it also seems to
                                           be more common in the academic associations than university publishers. Finally, we note
                                           that the total number of documents published per year is positively related to a journal having
                                           coerced and the impact of the average number of citations per document was not significantly
                                           different than zero.
                                               The result that higher-ranked journals seem to be more inclined than lower-ranked jour-
                                           nals to have practiced coercion warrants caution. These data contain many obscure journals;
                                           for example, there are more than 4000 publications categorized as medical journals and this
                                           long tail could create a misleading result. For instance, suppose some medical journals ranked
                                           between 1000–1200 most aggressively use the practice of coercion. In relative terms these are
                                           “high” ranked journals because 65% of the journals are ranked even lower than these clearly
                                           obscure publications. To account for this possibility, a second set of estimates was calculated
                                           after eliminating all but the “top-30” journals in each discipline. The results appear in Table 11

The unit of observation is a journal. The dependent variable for the logit model is binary: 1 = journal named as having coerced, 0 = not so named, and for the
frequency model the dependent variable is the number of times a journal was named as one that has coerced. Independent variables include the total
number of documents published by the journal in a year, the average references per document, the type of publisher, academic disciplines, and the journal’s
ranking as measured by the h-index.
* Indicates significance at the 5% level;
** significant at the 1% level.

Table 11 repeats analysis in Table 10 cutting sample to include only the top 30 journals in each discipline as measured by the h-index. The dependent
variable for the logit model is binary: 1 = journal named as having coerced, 0 = not so named, and for the frequency model the dependent variable is the
number of times a journal was named as one that has coerced. Independent variables include the total number of documents published by the journal in a
year, the average references per document, the type of publication, academic disciplines, and the journal’s ranking as measured by the h-index.
* Indicates significant at the 5% level;

                                                      SUBMISSION.” Again, more than 40% of the respondents said they agreed with that senti-
                                                      ment. Regarding grant proposals, 15% admitted to adding citations to their reference list in
                                                      grant proposals “even if those citations are of marginal import to my proposal.”
                                                         To see if reference padding is as systematic as the other types of manipulation studied
                                                      here, we use the categorical responses to the above questions as dependent variables and
                                                      estimate ordered logit models using the same descriptive independent variables as before.
                                                      The results for padding references in manuscripts and grant proposals appear in Tables 12
                                                      and 13, respectively. Once more, with minor deviation, our hypotheses are strongly

                                                      been coerced in the past are much more likely to pad citations before submitting a manuscript
                                                      to a journal. And, scholars who have added honorary authors to grant proposals are also more
                                                      likely to skew their citations to high-impact journals. While we cannot intuit the direction of
                                                      causation, we show evidence that those who manipulate in one dimension are willing to
                                                      manipulate in another.

                                           Discussion
                                           Our results are clear; academic misconduct, specifically misattribution, spans the academic
                                           universe. While there are different levels of abuse across disciplines, we found evidence of hon-
                                           orary authorship, coercive citation, and padded citation in every discipline we sampled. We
                                           also suggest that a useful construct to approach misattribution is to assume individual scholars
                                           make deliberate decisions to cheat after weighing the costs and benefits of that action. We can-
                                           not claim that our construct is universally true because other explanations may be possible,
                                           nor do we claim it explains all misattribution behavior because other factors can play a role.
                                           However, the systematic pattern of superfluous authors, coerced citations, and padded refer-
                                           ences documented here is consistent with scholars who making deliberate decisions to cheat
                                           after evaluating the costs and benefits of their behavior.
                                               Consider the use of honorary authorship in grant proposals. Out of the more than 2100
                                           individuals who gave a specific reason as to why they added a superfluous author to a grant
                                           proposal, one rationale outweighed the others; over 60% said they added the individual
                                           because of they thought the added scholar’s reputation increased their changes of a positive
                                           review. That behavior, adding someone with a reputation even though that individual isn’t
                                           expected to contribute to the work was reported across disciplines, academic ranks, and indi-
                                           viduals’ experience in grant work. Apparently, adding authors with highly recognized names
                                           to grant proposals has become part of the game and is practiced across disciplines and rank.
                                               Focusing on manuscripts, there is more variation in the stated reasons for honorary author-
                                           ship. Lab directors are added to papers in disciplines that are heavy lab users and junior faculty
                                           members are more likely to add individuals in positions of authority or mentors. Unlike grant
                                           proposals, few scholars add authors to manuscripts because of their reputation. A potential
                                           explanation for this difference is that many grant proposals are not blind reviewed, so grant
                                           reviewers know the research team and can be influenced by its members. Journals, however,
                                           often have blind referees, so while the reputation of a particular author might influence an edi-
                                           tor it should not influence referees. Furthermore, this might reflect the different review process
                                           of journals versus funding agencies. Funding agencies specifically consider the likelihood that
                                           a research team can complete a project and the project’s probability of making a significant
                                           contribution. Reputation can play a role in setting that perception. Such considerations are
                                           less prevalent in manuscript review because a submitted work is complete—the refereeing
                                           question is whether it is done well and whether it makes a significant contribution.
                                               Turning to coercive citations, our results in Tables 8 and 9 are also consistent with a model
                                           of coercion that assumes editors who engage in coercive citation do so mindfully; they are
                                           influenced by what others in their field are doing and if they coerce they take care to minimize
                                           the potential cost that their actions might trigger. Parallel analyses using a journal data base
                                           are also consistent with that view. In addition, the distinctive characteristics of each dataset
                                           illuminate different parts of the story. The author-based data suggests editors target their
                                           requests to minimize the potential cost of their activity by coercing less powerful authors and
                                           targeting manuscripts with fewer authors. However, contrary to the honorary authorship
                                           results, females are less likely to be coerced than males, ceteris paribus. The journal-based data
                                           adds that it is higher-ranked journals that seem to be more inclined to take the risk than lower
                                           ranked journals and that the type of publisher matters as well. Furthermore, both approaches
                                           suggest that certain fields, largely located in the business professions, are more likely to engage
                                           in coercive activities. This study did not investigate why business might be more actively
                                           engaged in academic misconduct because there was little theoretical reason to hypothesize this
                                           relationship. There is however some literature suggesting that ethics education in business
                                           schools has declined [34]. For the last 20–30 years business schools have turned to the mantra

                                           that stock holder value is the only pertinent concern of the firm. It is a small step to imagine
                                           that citation counts could be viewed as the only thing that matters for journals, but additional
                                           research is needed to flesh out such a claim.
                                               Again, we cannot claim that our cost-benefit model of editors who try to inflate their jour-
                                           nal impact factor score is the only possible explanation of coercion. Even if editors are follow-
                                           ing such a strategy, that does not rule out additional considerations that might also influence
                                           their behavior. Hopefully future research will help us understand the more complex motiva-
                                           tions behind the decision to manipulate and the subsequent behavior of scholars.
                                               Finally, it is clear that academics see value in padding citations as it is a relatively common
                                           behavior for both manuscripts and grants. Our results in Tables 12 and 13 also suggest that the
                                           use of honorary authorship and padding citations in grant proposals and coercive citation and
                                           padding citations in manuscripts is correlated. Scholars who have been coerced are more likely
                                           to pad citations before submitting their work and individuals who add authors to manuscripts
                                           also skew their references on their grant proposals. It seems that once scholars are willing to
                                           misrepresent authorship and/or citations, their misconduct is not limited to a single form of
                                           misattribution.
                                               It is difficult to examine these data without concluding that there is a significant level of
                                           deception in authorship and citation in academic research and while it would be naïve to sup-
                                           pose that academics are above such scheming to enhance their position, the results suggest oth-
                                           erwise. The overwhelming consensus is that such behavior is inappropriate, but its practice is
                                           common. It seems that academics are trapped; compelled to participate in activities they find
                                           distasteful. We suggest that the fuel that drives this cultural norm is the competition for
                                           research funding and high-quality journal space coupled with the intense focus on a single
                                           measure of performance, the number of publications or grants. That competition cuts both
                                           ways, on the one hand it focuses creativity, hones research contributions, and distinguishes
                                           between significant contributions and incremental advances. On the other hand, such compe-
                                           tition creates incentives to take shortcuts to inflate ones’ research metrics by strategically
                                           manipulating attribution. This puts academics at odds with their core ethical beliefs.
                                               The competition for research resources is getting tighter and if there is an advantage to be
                                           gained by misbehaving then the odds that academics will misbehave increase; left unchecked,
                                           the manipulation of authorship and citation will continue to grow. Different types of attribu-
                                           tion manipulation continue to emerge; citation cartels (where editors at multiple journals
                                           agree to pad the other journals’ impact factor) and journals that publish anything for a fee
                                           while falsely claiming peer-review are two examples [30, 35].
                                               It will be difficult to eliminate such activities, but some steps can probably help. Policy
                                           actions aimed at attribution manipulation need to reduce the benefits of manipulation and/or
                                           increase the cost. One of the driving incentives of honorary authorship is that the number of
                                           publications has become a focal point of evaluation and that number is not sufficiently dis-
                                           counted by the number of authors [36]. So, if a publication with x authors counted as 1/x pub-
                                           lications for each of the authors, the ability to inflate one’s vita is reduced. There are problems
                                           of course, such as who would implement such a policy, but some of these problems can be
                                           addressed. For example if the online, automated citation counts (e.g., h-index, impact factor,
                                           calculators such as SCOPUS and Google Scholar) automatically discounted their statistics by
                                           the number of authors, it could eventually influence the entire academe. Other shortcomings
                                           of this policy is that this simple discounting does not allow for differential credit to be given
                                           that may be warranted, nor does it remove the power disparity in academic ranks. However, it
                                           does stiffen the resistance to adding authors and that is a crucial step.
                                               An increasing number of journals, especially in medicine, are adopting authorship guide-
                                           lines developed by independent groups, the most common being set forth by the International

                                           Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) [37]. To date, however, there is little evidence
                                           that those standards have significantly altered behavior; although it is not clear if that is
                                           because authors are manipulating in spite of the rules, if the rules are poorly enforced, or if
                                           they are poorly designed from an implementation perspective [21]. Some journals require
                                           authors to specifically enumerate each author’s contribution and require all of the authors to
                                           sign off on that division of labor. Such delineation would be even more effective if authorship
                                           credit was weighted by that division of labor. Additional research is warranted.
                                              There may be greater opportunities to reduce the practice of coercive citation. A funda-
                                           mental difference between coercion and honorary authorship is the paper trail. Editors write
                                           down such “requests” to authors, therefore violations are easier to document and enforcement
                                           is more straightforward. First, it is clear that impact factors should no longer include self-cita-
                                           tions. This simple act removes the incentive to coerce authors. Reuters makes such calcula-
                                           tions and publishes impact factors including and excluding self-citations. However, the
                                           existence of multiple impact factors gives journals the opportunity to adopt and advertise the
                                           factor that puts them in the best light, which means that journals with editors who practice
                                           coercion can continue to use impact factors that can be manipulated. Thus, self-citations
                                           should be removed from all impact factor calculations. This does not eliminate other forms of
                                           impact factor manipulation such as posting accepted articles on the web and accumulating
                                           citations prior to official publication, but it removes the benefit of editorial coercion and other
                                           strategies based on inflating self-citation [38]. Second, journals should explicitly ban their edi-
                                           tors from coercing. Some journals are taking these steps and while words do not insure prac-
                                           tice, a code of ethics reinforces appropriate behavior because it more closely ties a journal’s
                                           reputation to the practices of its editors and should increase the oversight of editorial boards.
                                           Some progress is being made on the adoption of editorial guidelines, but whether they have
                                           any impact is currently unknown [39, 40].
                                              These results also reinforce the idea that grant proposals be double blind-reviewed. Blind-
                                           review shifts the decision calculus towards the merit of a proposal and reduces honorary
                                           authorship incentives. The current system can inadvertently encourage misattribution. For
                                           example, scholars are often encouraged to visit granting agencies to meet with reviewers and
                                           directors of programs to talk about high-interest research areas. Such visits make sense, but it is
                                           easy for those scholars to interpret their visit as a name-collecting exercise; finding people to
                                           add to proposals and collecting references to cite. Fourth, academic administrators, Provosts,
                                           Deans, and Chairs need to have clear rules concerning authorship. Far too many of our respon-
                                           dents said they added a name to their work because that individual could have an impact on
                                           their career. They also need to have guidelines that address the inclusion of mentors and lab
                                           directors to author lists. Proposals that include name-recognizable scholars for only a small
                                           proportion of the grant should be viewed with suspicion. This is a consideration in some grant
                                           opportunities, but that linkage can be strengthened. Finally, there is some evidence that men-
                                           toring can be effective, but there is a real question as to whether mentors are teaching compli-
                                           ance or how to cheat [41].
                                              There are limitations in this study. Although surveys have shortcomings such as self-report-
                                           ing bias, self-selection issues, etc., there are some issues for which surveys remain as the data
                                           collection method of choice. Manipulation is one of these issues. It would be difficult to deter-
                                           mine if someone added honorary authors or padded citations prior to submission without ask-
                                           ing that individual. Similarly, coercion is most directly addressed by asking authors if editors
                                           coerced them for citations. Other approaches, such as examining archival data, running exper-
                                           iments, or building simulations, will not work. Thus, despite its shortcomings, survey is the
                                           method of choice.

                                               Our survey was sent via email and the overall response rate was 10.5%, which by traditional
                                           survey standards may be considered to be low. We have no data on how many surveys were
                                           filtered as spam or otherwise ended up in junk mail folders or how many addresses were obso-
                                           lete. We recognize however that there is a rising hesitancy by individuals to click on an emailed
                                           link and that is what we were asking our recipients to do. For these reasons, we anticipated
                                           that our response rate may be low and compensated by increasing the number of surveys sent
                                           out. In the end, we have over 12,000 responses and found thousands of scholars who have par-
                                           ticipated in manipulation. In the S1 appendix, Table A presents response rates by discipline
                                           and while there is variation across disciplines, that variation does not correlate with any of the
                                           fundamental results, that is, there does not seem to be a discipline bias arising from differential
                                           response rates.
                                               A major concern when conducting survey research is that the sample may not represent the
                                           population. To address this possible issue in our study, we perform various statistical analyses
                                           to determine if we encountered sampling bias. First, we compared two population demograph-
                                           ics (sex and academic rank) to the demographics of our respondents (see Table B in S1 Appen-
                                           dix). The percentage of males and females in each discipline was very close to the reported sex
                                           of the respondents. There was greater variation in academic ranks with the rank of full profes-
                                           sor being over-represented in our sample. One should keep this in mind when interpreting
                                           our findings. However, our hypotheses and results suggest that professors are the least likely to
                                           be coerced, use padded citations, and use honorary authorship, consequently our results may
                                           actually under-estimate the incidence of manipulation. Perhaps the greatest concern of poten-
                                           tial bias innate in surveys comes from the intuition that individuals who are more intimately
                                           affected by a particular issue are more likely to respond. In the current study, it is plausible
                                           that scholars who have been coerced, or felt obligated to add authors to manuscripts, or have
                                           added investigators to grants proposals, are upset by that consequence and more likely to
                                           respond. However, if that motivation biased our responses it should show up in the response
                                           rates across disciplines, i.e., disciplines reporting a greater incidence of manipulation should
                                           have higher percentage of their population experiencing manipulation and thus higher
                                           response rates. The rank correlation coefficient between discipline response rates and the pro-
                                           portion of scholars reporting manipulation is rs = -0.181, suggesting virtually no relationship
                                           between the two measures.
                                               In the end, we cannot rule out the existence of bias but we find no evidence that suggests it
                                           affects our results. We are left with the conclusion that scholars manipulate attribution adding
                                           honorary authors to their manuscripts and false investigators to their grant proposals, and
                                           some editors coerce scholars to add citations that are not pertinent to their work. It is unlikely
                                           that this unethical behavior can be totally eliminated because academics are a competitive,
                                           intelligent, and creative group of individuals. However, most of our respondents say they want
                                           to play it straight and therefore, by reducing the incentives of misbehavior and raising the
                                           costs of inappropriate attribution, we can expect a substantial portion of the community to go
                                           along. With this inherent support and some changes to the way we measure scientific contri-
                                           butions, we may reduce attribution misbehavior in academia [42].
