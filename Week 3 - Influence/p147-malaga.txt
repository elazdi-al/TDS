  rank well for. While a good SEO consul-
  tant may make recommendations, you
  must make the final decisions. Many
  unscrupulous consultants guarantee a
  high ranking, but you may find that the
  key words are not very competitive or
  searched for often. Third, do not turn
  over your site to a consultant. The con-
  sultant should recommend changes,
  but black hats have been known to in-
  sert too many key words and even add
  automated software to sites to connect
  them to link farms. Finally, get referenc-
  es. Be sure to ask about specific results
  and return on investment.
     Of course there is no requirement to
  hire an outside consultant. Many sites
  have done very well handling their SEO
  in-house. There are numerous online
  resources, such as www.seochat.com,
  www.searchenginewatch.com, and fo-
  rums.digitalpoint.com that provide a
  wealth of excellent information on SEO.
     While they might like to, Webmas-
  ters cannot simply ignore black hat
  optimization. Black hat methods may
  lead to worse rankings for white hat
  sites – through black hat sites that rank
  well temporarily and techniques aimed
  at bowling sites. In addition, white hats
  should not ignore black hat approach-
  es as they can learn or adapt new SEO
  methods from them. For example, many
  white hat optimizers have successfully
  used the Blog and ping approach, in
  a more moderate manner, to achieve
  quick search engine indexing.
