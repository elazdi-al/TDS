experiments, we recruited 102 eligible voters through newspaper
and online advertisements, as well through notices in senior
recreation centers, in the San Diego, CA, area.* The advertise-
ments offered USD$25 for each subject’s participation, and
subjects were prescreened in an attempt to match diverse de-

   Each of the three experiments used 30 actual search results
and corresponding Web pages relating to the 2010 election to
determine the prime minister of Australia. The candidates were
Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard, and the order in which their
names were presented was counterbalanced in all conditions.
This election was used to minimize possible preexisting biases by
US study participants and thus to try to guarantee that our
subjects would be truly “undecided.” In each experiment, sub-
jects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (i) rankings
favoring Gillard (which means that higher-ranked search results
linked to Web pages that portrayed Gillard as the better candi-
date), (ii) rankings favoring Abbott, or (iii) rankings favoring
neither (Fig. 1 A–C). The order of these rankings was deter-
