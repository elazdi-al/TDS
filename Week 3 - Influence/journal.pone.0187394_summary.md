# Summary: Authorship and Citation Manipulation in Academic Research

**Source:** Fong EA, Wilhite AW (2017). Authorship and citation manipulation in academic research. *PLoS ONE* 12(12): e0187394.

## Overview
This study investigates the prevalence and systematic nature of academic misconduct regarding attribution—specifically **honorary authorship**, **coercive citation**, and **padded citations**—in research manuscripts and grant proposals. Based on over 12,000 survey responses from scholars across 18 disciplines (including science, engineering, medicine, business, and social sciences) and analysis of journal data, the authors argue that scholars make deliberate cost-benefit calculations to manipulate attribution in response to intense competition for publication and funding.

## Key Concepts
*   **Honorary Authorship:** Adding individuals as authors who contributed little or nothing to the research effort.
*   **Coercive Citation:** Editors directing authors to add citations to the editor's journal even when not pertinent to the work.
*   **Padded Citations:** Authors purposely adding superfluous citations to their reference lists to influence editors, reviewers, or grant panels.

## Methodology
*   **Surveys:** Four waves of surveys (2010–2014) sent to >110,000 scholars in 18 disciplines, yielding ~12,000 responses.
*   **Journal Data:** Analysis of Scopus data for >16,000 journals to identify institutional factors associated with coercion.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Logit and negative binomial regression models to identify predictors of manipulation based on academic rank, discipline, gender, and publication history.

## Major Findings

### 1. Honorary Authorship
*   **Prevalence:** 
    *   **35.5%** of respondents added honorary authors to *research manuscripts*.
    *   **20.8%** added honorary authors to *grant proposals*.
*   **Who Manipulates:**
    *   **Junior Faculty:** Assistant and Associate Professors are significantly more likely to add honorary authors than full Professors.
    *   **Research Faculty:** Highly likely to add honorary authors (often Lab Directors).
    *   **Gender:** Female scholars are more likely to feel obligated to add honorary authors than males.
    *   **Team Size:** Manuscripts with more existing co-authors are more likely to add honorary authors (since the "cost" of diluted credit is lower).
*   **Disciplines:** Most frequent in **Medicine, Nursing, Engineering, Ecology, Management, and Marketing**. Least frequent in Political Science and Mathematics.
*   **Reasons:**
    *   **Manuscripts:** "Lab Director" (28.4%), "Position of Authority" (21.4%), and "Mentor" (13.2%).
    *   **Grants:** Overwhelmingly driven by **"Reputation"** (60.8%)—adding a big name to increase the odds of funding.

### 2. Coercive Citation
*   **Prevalence:** **14.1%** of respondents reported being coerced by editors to add irrelevant citations.
*   **Targets:** Editors tend to target **junior faculty** (who need publications for tenure) and **manuscripts with fewer authors** (fewer people to offend).
*   **Journal Characteristics:**
    *   **Business disciplines** (Marketing, Management, Finance, IS) are significantly more likely to coerce than others.
    *   Contrary to expectations, **higher-ranked journals** (higher h-index) are *more* likely to coerce (or have achieved their rank through coercion).
    *   Journals from **commercial publishers** and academic associations coerce more than university presses.
*   **Gender Conflict:** Surveys suggest males are more often coerced, whereas the journal data analysis suggests females might be less targeted.

### 3. Padded Citations
*   **Prevalence:**
    *   **>40%** of respondents would add superfluous citations to a manuscript if they believed the journal expected it.
    *   **15%** admitted to skewing citations in grant proposals toward high-impact journals.
*   **Correlation:** Misconduct is correlated; scholars who have been coerced or who utilize honorary authorship are significantly more likely to pad citations.

## Discussion & Conclusion
*   **Systematic Cheating:** Misattribution is not random; it is a strategic response to the "publish or perish" culture. Academics weigh the benefits (tenure, funding, acceptance) against the costs (diluted credit, ethics) and often choose to manipulate.
*   **The "Game":** Grant proposals are particularly susceptible to name-dropping ("reputation" as a driver), likely because many review processes are not blind.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Discount citation/publication counts by the number of authors (e.g., credit = 1/n).
    *   Exclude self-citations from Journal Impact Factor calculations to remove the incentive for coercion.
    *   Implement double-blind reviews for grant proposals to reduce reputation-based bias.
    *   Establish clear institutional guidelines for authorship, particularly regarding mentors and lab directors.
