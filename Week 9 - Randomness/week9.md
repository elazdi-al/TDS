# Week 9: Randomness in Democratic Processes

This lecture explores the historical and contemporary uses of randomness in democratic processes, highlighting its benefits, challenges, and trade-offs—particularly regarding anti-corruption, fairness, and expertise.

## Part 1: Historical Precedents for Randomness in Democracy

### 1. Trial by Jury (U.S.)
- **Purpose:** Ensures fairness and impartiality by selecting a diverse, representative group of ordinary citizens.
- **Rationale:** Expert judges and lawyers may carry biases (socioeconomic, racial) that a randomly selected jury of peers might not.
- **Key Benefit:** Ordinary people may better understand an ordinary person's situation.

### 2. Random Vote Counters (Switzerland)
- **Purpose:** Prevents election fraud and corruption.
- **Mechanism:** Vote counters are randomly selected before each election.
- **Why Random?**
  - Makes it extremely difficult for anyone to corrupt or bribe vote counters in advance.
  - Constant rotation prevents predictability and manipulation.

### 3. Exit Polling
- **Purpose:** Predict election outcomes by sampling voters immediately after they vote.
- **Limitations:**
  - Self-selecting sample (some people are more willing to respond than others).
  - Known to produce gaps between predicted and actual results.
- **Controversy:** Raises questions about voter anonymity and influence on remaining voters.

### 4. Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs)
- **Definition:** A statistical method to verify election integrity by randomly sampling a small number of paper ballots.
- **How It Works:**
  - Assumes votes are cast on paper (even if printed by a machine).
  - A random sample of ballots is counted independently and compared to official results.
  - Statistical math determines if discrepancies are within normal chance or indicate a problem.
- **Key Benefit:** Provides a strong, efficient safeguard against counting errors or fraud without a full recount.

### 5. Tie-Breaking by Coin Flip
- **Use Case:** When an election results in an exact tie (rare but possible, especially in smaller bodies).
- **Purpose:** Preserves fairness; ensures progress without costly re-votes.
- **Principle:** Neither party gains a fundamental advantage; democracy moves forward.

### 6. Randomness in Single Transferable Vote (STV)
- **Context:** When a candidate exceeds the quota, surplus votes must be redistributed to next choices.
- **One Method:** Randomly select which surplus ballots are transferred.
- **Trade-off:**
  - *Pro:* Simple, fair, quick.
  - *Con:* Makes the election non-deterministic (outcomes may vary with different random draws).

## Part 2: Ancient Athenian Democracy & the Origin of "Lottery"

### Athenian Magistrates
- **Context:** Athenian democracy relied heavily on executive positions called **magistrates** (similar to modern roles like mayor or police chief).
- **Selection Method:** Chosen **randomly by lot** from eligible citizens using a device called a **kleroteria** (the origin of the word "lottery").
- **Rules:**
  - Each magistrate served for only **one year**.
  - A person could only hold a specific magistrate position **once in their lifetime**.
  - Showing **desire** for a position could disqualify you.
- **Rationale:**
  - **Anti-corruption:** New, unattached individuals are less likely to abuse power.
  - **Prevention of entrenched power:** No one becomes "too comfortable" in a position of authority.

### Trade-off: Expertise vs. Anti-Corruption
| Randomness (Anti-Corruption) | Expertise |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| Newbies with no special interest or expertise | Experienced individuals who may become corrupt over time |
| Difficult to manipulate or bribe in advance | May have vested interests or biases |
| Diversity and fresh perspectives | Deeper knowledge and efficiency |

> **Key Insight:** Modern democracies should reconsider this trade-off—how much expertise is needed vs. the anti-corruption benefits of randomness?

## Part 3: The Venetian Doge Election Process (1300–1800)

### Context
- **Doge:** The top leader of the Venetian Republic, elected for life.
- **The Great Council:** The body of noble citizens eligible to participate in the election.
- **Problem:** Rampant factionalism and risk of manipulation by powerful families.

### The Multi-Stage Election Process

The Venetians developed a complex, iterative process alternating between **random selection (by lot)** and **deliberation**:

| Step | Action                                          |
|------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | From the Great Council, randomly select **30** |
| 2    | Randomly reduce to **9**                        |
| 3    | The 9 deliberate and choose **40**              |
| 4    | Randomly reduce to **20**                       |
| 5    | Randomly reduce to **12**                       |
| 6    | The 12 deliberate and choose **25**             |
| 7    | Randomly reduce to **9**                        |
| 8    | The 9 deliberate and choose **45**              |
| 9    | Randomly reduce to **11**                       |
| 10   | The 11 deliberate and choose **41**             |
| 11   | The 41 deliberate and **elect the Doge**        |

### Why This Design?

1. **Anti-Corruption / Anti-Manipulation:**
   - Impossible for any faction to predict or control outcomes across so many random rounds.
   - Even if you try to insert allies at one stage, they may not survive the next random cut.

2. **Increased Randomness/Entropy:**
   - Multiple layers of randomness ensure true unpredictability.

3. **Progressive Expertise Building (Speculation):**
   - Each deliberative group might select members with slightly better knowledge than the previous group.
   - Over iterations, the average expertise could increase while still being unpredictable.

4. **Greater Participation & Buy-In:**
   - More people involved in the process = more legitimacy and acceptance of the outcome.
   - Reduces likelihood of rebellion or rejection of results.

## Part 4: Deliberative Polling & Mini-Publics (Citizens' Assemblies)

### What Are They?
- **Deliberative Polling:** A process where a random sample of citizens is convened to discuss, learn about, and form opinions on a specific issue.
- **Mini-Publics / Citizens' Assemblies:** Similar bodies tasked with producing recommendations or reports on policy matters.

### The Process (Fishkin Model)

1. **Random Sampling:** Participants are selected similarly to traditional opinion polls.
2. **Incentivization:** Participants receive monetary compensation for full participation.
3. **Initial Poll:** Participants' initial opinions are recorded (often uninformed at this stage).
4. **Education & Deliberation Phase:**
   - Participants explore materials, read up on the issue, and hear from invited experts.
   - Discussion among participants is encouraged.
5. **Final Poll:** Opinions are recorded again after deliberation.
6. **Output:** May produce a written document summarizing areas of consensus and disagreement.

### Benefits of Deliberative Polling & Mini-Publics

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Increased Knowledge** | Participants become genuinely educated on the issue. |
| **Direct Democracy (Scalable)** | Ordinary citizens decide directly, but can run many small groups in parallel on different issues. |
| **Diversity & Representativeness** | Random sampling ensures inclusion of varied ages, professions, backgrounds. |
| **Inclusivity (by proxy)** | Even non-participants may identify with someone demographically similar, increasing buy-in. |
| **Consensus Building** | In-person discussion can bridge divides and foster understanding. |

### Potential Issues & Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sampling Manipulation** | If sampling is not truly random or transparent, bias can be introduced. |
| **Agenda Setting Bias** | Organizers control what's discussed, which experts are invited, and which viewpoints are represented. |
| **Polarization Risk** | Divisive topics or strong personalities can derail discussions or deepen divisions. |
| **Moderation Dependency** | Success heavily depends on having a skilled, neutral moderator. |
| **Non-Selection Exclusion** | Most citizens won't be selected, so full participation is not achieved. |

### Agenda Setting: A Key Unsolved Problem
- Currently, **organizers** typically control the agenda (topics discussed, experts invited).
- This introduces potential bias and manipulation.
- **Future Work:** Developing mechanisms for **democratic, transparent agenda-setting** is an important research frontier.
