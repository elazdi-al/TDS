# Voting Behaviour and Power in Online Democracy: A Study of LiquidFeedback in Germany’s Pirate Party

## Overview
This paper, published in the *Proceedings of the Ninth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media*, investigates the dynamics of **LiquidFeedback**, an online delegative democracy platform used by the **German Pirate Party**. The authors analyze a dataset spanning from 2009 to 2013 to understand voting behavior, the emergence of "super-voters," and the distribution of power within the system.

## Key Research Questions
1.  **Voting Behavior:** How do people vote and delegate in a delegative democracy?
2.  **Super-Voters:** Do powerful users (super-voters) emerge, and do they undermine the democratic process?
3.  **Power Indices:** How can voting power be accurately assessed in such a dynamic, non-uniform system?

## Findings on Voting Behavior and Super-Voters
*   **Emergence of Super-Voters:** The study confirms the existence of super-voters. The distribution of voting weights follows a power law, meaning a small number of users receive a vast majority of delegations.
*   **Activity Levels:** Delegates (super-voters) participate significantly more often in votes than average users.
*   **Delegation Motivation:** Delegations do not appear to be primarily driven by shared voting history or political alignment, as the agreement rate between delegators and delegates is only marginally higher than random pairings.
*   **Stabilizing Effect:** Contrary to fears that super-voters might abuse their power to overturn results, the data shows they often vote with the majority. They tend to act as a **stabilizing force**, preventing stagnation by compensating for the tendency of experienced direct voters to become more critical (and thus negative) over time.
*   **Social Control:** The authors hypothesize that super-voters feel "social pressure" to use their weight responsibly, often avoiding negative votes that would unilaterally kill a proposal.

## Power Indices: Theoretical vs. Empirical
The paper critiques valid existing game-theoretic power indices (like **Shapley** and **Banzhaf**) for failing to predict actual power dynamics in LiquidFeedback.
*   **Failure of Traditional Indices:** These indices wrongly assume "uniformity" (voters are equally likely to vote yes/no) and "independence" (voters decide separately). In reality, the system shows a strong **positivity bias** (most proposals are approved) and correlated behavior.
*   **New Indices Proposed:**
    *   **Beta Power Index:** Generalizes the Banzhaf index using a Beta distribution to model observed approval rates.
    *   **Regression Power Index:** Uses logistic regression to account for the impact of delegations on approval rates.
    *   **Beta2 Power Index:** A generalization of the Shapley index. It assumes voters have **homogeneous opinions** (agreeing with a proposal with probability *p*) but *p* itself is drawn from a Beta distribution to reflect the system's bias.

## Conclusion and Contributions
*   **Beta2 Superiority:** The **Beta2 index** significantly outperformed all other indices in predicting potential power, providing a much more accurate tool for analyzing delegative democracies.
*   **Viability of Liquid Democracy:** The study concludes that the "super-voter" phenomenon does not necessarily threaten democracy. In the German Pirate Party, these powerful actors used their influence wisely, often aligning with the majority and ensuring the system remained functional and productive.
