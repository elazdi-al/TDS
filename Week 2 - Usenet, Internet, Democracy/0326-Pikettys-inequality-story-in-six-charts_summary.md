# Piketty's Inequality Story in Six Charts — Summary

## Overview

This article presents six key charts from economist Thomas Piketty's influential work, illustrating the historical trajectory of income and wealth inequality. The analysis combines data from individual tax records and cross-country research to reshape the inequality debate—shifting focus from median incomes to the remarkable gains of the top 1% and 10%.

## The Six Charts

### 1. U.S. Income Share of the Top 10% (1910–2010)
- Shows a **U-shaped pattern**: inequality peaked in the Roaring Twenties, fell sharply after the 1929 crash, stayed stable from the mid-1940s to mid-1970s, then surged again.
- By 2007, inequality surpassed 1928 levels; by 2012, the top 10% took over **50% of all income**.

### 2. U.S. Income Share of the Top 1% (1910–2010)
- Same U-shaped pattern as Chart 1.
- The rise is more dramatic when including **capital income** (dividends, interest, capital gains), not just wages.
- The wealthy derive much of their income from wealth ownership.

### 3. Anglo-Saxon Countries Comparison (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia)
- Since 1980, the income share of the top 1% has risen sharply in all four countries.
- The **U.S. leads in inequality**—a reversal from 90 years ago when the U.K. was more unequal.
- Piketty notes U.S. wage inequality is "probably higher than in any other society at any time in the past, anywhere in the world."

### 4. Developing Countries (Argentina, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, South Africa)
- Similar U-shape: income accumulating at the top over recent decades.
- **Most have less inequality than the U.S.**, with Colombia being the closest exception.
- Even highly stratified nations like Argentina, Indonesia, and South Africa show lower top-1% shares than the U.S.

### 5. Wealth Concentration: U.S. vs. Europe (1810–2010)
- Historically, European elites owned more wealth than American elites.
- **Roles have reversed**: In 2010, the U.S. top 1% owned ~33% of all wealth; in Europe, ~25%.
- Piketty warns the U.S. is "on the verge of becoming the Old Europe of the twenty-first century's globalized economy."

### 6. Rate of Return on Capital vs. Economic Growth (Antiquity–2100)
- Piketty's **"central contradiction of capitalism"**: when the return on capital (r) exceeds economic growth (g), inequality rises.
- The 20th century was a **historic exception**—growth roughly matched returns.
- Piketty predicts growth will fall below returns again, with "potentially terrifying" consequences for wealth distribution.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Inequality follows historical cycles**: The mid-20th century's relative equality was an anomaly, not a norm.
2. **The U.S. is now the most unequal advanced economy**, surpassing historical European class-bound societies.
3. **Capital income drives inequality**: The wealthy benefit disproportionately from returns on investments.
4. **Policy implications**: The data makes redistribution and political responses to inequality unavoidable topics.
5. **Future concern**: If r > g continues, wealth concentration will accelerate in the coming decades.
