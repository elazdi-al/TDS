# Measuring User Influence in Twitter: The Million Follower Fallacy

## Summary

This paper, published in the Proceedings of the Fourth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, presents an empirical analysis of influence patterns on Twitter using a massive dataset of **54 million users**, **2 billion follow links**, and **1.7 billion tweets**.

## Key Concepts

### The Million Follower Fallacy
The central finding challenges a common assumption: **having a million followers does not necessarily mean a user is influential**. Indegree (follower count) alone reveals very little about actual influence. Instead, having an *active audience* who retweets or mentions the user is more meaningful.

### Three Measures of Influence
The paper defines and compares three distinct measures:

1. **Indegree Influence** — The number of followers a user has. Represents **popularity** and audience size.
2. **Retweet Influence** — How often a user's tweets are retweeted. Represents the **content value** of one's tweets.
3. **Mention Influence** — How often a user is mentioned by others. Represents the **name value** and ability to engage others in conversation.

### Key Insight: Top Users Differ by Measure
- **Most followed users**: CNN, New York Times, Barack Obama, Ashton Kutcher, Britney Spears (a mix of news sources, politicians, celebrities).
- **Most retweeted users**: Mashable, TwitterTips, TweetMeme, Guy Kawasaki, The New York Times (content aggregators, businessmen, news sites).
- **Most mentioned users**: Mostly celebrities—users show passion for celebrity gossip and mentioning famous individuals.

**Critical finding**: The top-20 lists for each measure had only **2 users in common** (Ashton Kutcher and Puff Daddy), demonstrating that the three measures capture fundamentally different types of influence.

## Theoretical Background

### Traditional View (Influentials Theory)
A minority of "opinion leaders" or "innovators" possess qualities that make them exceptionally persuasive. By targeting these influentials, viral marketing can spread to a wide audience at low cost. This theory has been widely adopted in marketing (e.g., RoperASW, Tremor).

### Modern View (Peer Networks)
Recent research argues that people make choices based on **peer and friend opinions** rather than relying on influentials. Simulations show that influentials are neither necessary nor sufficient for diffusion; a trend's success depends more on how **susceptible society is** to that trend. This leads to the concept of "accidental influentials."

## Findings on Influence Dynamics

### Influence Across Topics
Studying three major 2009 events—**Iran Election**, **Swine Flu (H1N1)**, and **Michael Jackson's Death**—the paper found:

- **Power-law distribution**: The top influentials were retweeted/mentioned disproportionately more than ordinary users.
- **Cross-topic influence**: Most influential users can hold **significant influence over a variety of topics**. Top users like Mashable, CNN Breaking News, and TweetMeme maintained high influence across all three events.
- **Mentions transfer more easily**: A user who is good at spawning mentions can do so across diverse topics more easily than through retweets.

### Influence Over Time
Tracking 233 "all-time influentials" over 8 months in 2009:

| Group | Retweet Trend | Mention Trend |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Top 10 (mainstream news) | Mildly increased | **Declined** over time |
| Top 11–100 (celebrities) | Mildly increased | Consistent |
| Top 101–233 (evangelists/opinion leaders) | Mildly increased | **Increased** over time |

**Key insight**: Mainstream news organizations are retweeted the most but not mentioned the most—their value is in content, not identity. Celebrities are mentioned more because of their name value. Evangelists and opinion leaders increased their influence by **actively engaging with their audience** (e.g., replying to followers).

### Rising Influence of Ordinary Users
"Topical influentials" (ordinary users who became popular during a specific event) showed distinct patterns:
- Accounts like **iranbaan** and **oxfordgirl** were "unheard-of" before the Iran election but suddenly became influential.
- Users who **limit their tweets to a single topic** showed the largest increase in influence.
- Influence is **not gained spontaneously or accidentally**, but through **concerted effort**.

## Implications for Viral Marketing

1. **Indegree is not enough**: High follower count ≠ high influence. Active engagement (retweets, mentions) matters more.
2. **Target top influentials**: The power-law distribution means targeting the top influentials is substantially more effective than employing a massive number of ordinary users.
3. **Cross-topic influence works**: Popular users can be used to spread information outside their area of expertise.
4. **Effort matters**: To gain and maintain influence, users need **consistent personal involvement**—posting creative/insightful tweets and engaging with their audience.
5. **Influentials are more predictable than suggested**: Unlike the "accidental influentials" hypothesis, influential users show consistent effort and predictable behavior.

## Methodology Notes

- **Dataset**: 54 million users, 1.96 billion follow links, 1.75 billion tweets (collected August 2009).
- **Active users**: 6 million users who posted ≥10 tweets.
- **Rank correlation**: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient used to compare influence measures.
- **Normalization**: Influence over time was normalized by total tweets to account for network growth (similar to Google's search trend normalization).
