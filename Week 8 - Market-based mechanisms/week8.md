# Week 8: Market-based Mechanisms

This week explores using economic and market-based mechanisms to achieve social goods or improve democratic processes. The discussion focuses on three main experimental technologies: Crowdfunding, Prediction Markets, and Quadratic Voting.

## 1. Crowdfunding
A mainstream mechanism where groups raise funds directly from the public (the "crowd") to finance ideas, products, or needs.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Mechanism:** Creators propose a project; the community funds it via donations or pre-purchases.
- **Use Cases:**
  - **Niche Products:** Funding items too specific/risky for traditional investors.
  - **Community Action:** Solving local problems government ignores (e.g., fixing potholes).
  - **Political/Social tools:** Empowering sidelined minorities, political campaigns, or protest actions.

### **Issues & Risks**
- **Role of Government:** Can displace government responsibility (e.g., if citizens fix roads, government faces less pressure to do its job).
- **Inequity:** Highly dependent on the wealth of the target community (e.g., rich neighborhoods crowdfunding better school equipment vs. poor neighborhoods).
- **Arbitrariness:** Success often depends on "flashiness" or marketing rather than merit.
- **Scams & Pressure:** Risk of fraud (though less common than expected) and immense pressure on creators to deliver.

## 2. Prediction Markets
Using betting markets to predict future outcomes (e.g., elections), coined as "Gambling for Good."

### **Key Concepts**
- **Mechanism:** Participants buy/sell shares in an outcome (e.g., "Candidate A wins"). The market price reflects the collective probability estimate.
- **Value:** Aggregates diffuse information from many people, often producing more accurate predictions than experts.

### **Issues & Risks**
- **Manipulation:** "Whales" with large funds can manipulate prices to create false perceptions (e.g., creating momentum for a "dark horse" candidate), potentially becoming self-fulfilling prophecies.
- **Insider Trading:** Participants with privileged/non-public information essentially rig the market.
- **Legal Gray Areas:** Unclear legal status (Gambling? Investing? Voting?).
- **The Oracle Problem:** Requires a definitive, trusted source to verify the actual outcome. Disagreements on the result can lead to conflict (similar to blockchain forks).
- **Wealth Bias:** Market prices may reflect the beliefs of the wealthy participants rather than the general population.

## 3. Quadratic Voting (QV)
An experimental voting system designed to allow voters to express the *strength* of their preferences.

### **Key Concepts**
- **The Rule:** Voters receive a budget of "credits". The cost of casting $n$ votes on a single issue is $n^2$ credits.
  - *Example:* 1 vote costs 1 credit. 2 votes cost 4 credits. 10 votes cost 100 credits.
- **Incentive Compatibility:** Encourages voters to spread influence across issues they care about moderately, while allowing them to concentrate heavily on issues they care about deeply (at a high cost).
- **Goal:** To find a "sweet spot" between "One Person One Vote" (which ignores intensity of preference) and market buying (which favors the rich).

### **Issues & Risks**
- **Distraction Politics:** Malicious actors could introduce "bright shiny objects" (hot-button but irrelevant issues) to trick voters into wasting their credits, leaving meaningful decisions to the manipulators.
- **Complexity:** likely too mathematical/complex for the general public to understand and trust.
- **Fairness to Vulnerable Groups:** Minorities protecting basic rights (e.g., civil rights) are forced to spend all their political capital on survival, losing influence on other societal topics.
- **Collusion:** Voters could trade credits/votes illegally to bypass the quadratic cost scaling.
- **Educational Disincentive:** May encourage voters to ignore topics they don't care about, rather than becoming informed citizens on all issues.

## Conclusion
While no voting system is perfect, these mechanisms offer alternatives to traditional methods. The lecturer maintains some skepticism, particularly regarding the vulnerability of these systems to manipulation and complexity, but acknowledges their potential value in specific contexts compared to universally criticized systems like First-Past-The-Post.
