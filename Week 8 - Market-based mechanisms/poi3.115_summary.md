## Overview

This article examines the emergence of **democratic deliberation** within a **crowdsourced law reform process** in Finland. The study investigates whether crowdsourcing—typically used for knowledge and idea gathering—can also foster meaningful democratic deliberation among participants, even when deliberation is not the primary design goal.

## Key Concepts

### Democratic Deliberation

- **Definition:** "The public use of arguments and reasoning among free and equal individuals" (adapted from Cohen, 1989).
- **Core Characteristics:**
  - An **exchange of arguments** where participants aim to convince others or refute claims.
  - **Distinct from bargaining** (which appeals to self-interest) or threatening.
  - An **intersubjective exercise** occurring between at least two individuals.
  - Arguments need not be formal syllogisms—they can take the form of **stories, anecdotes**, or other rhetorical forms that can be reconstructed as arguments.
  - Requires **equal standing among free participants** and the **public nature** of the exchange.

- **Additional Criteria (more demanding views):**
  - Mutual respect, reciprocity, and civility.
  - Truthfulness and sincerity.
  - Normative goal of rational consensus (though modern deliberative democrats often relax this).

### Crowdsourcing

- **Definition:** An open call for anyone to participate in an online task by submitting information, knowledge, or talent.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - No predefined target group—participants **self-select** from a larger pool.
  - Can be voluntary or paid.
  - Types include: **microtasking, idea generation, knowledge search, and argumentation**.
- **In Policymaking:** The crowd contributes to the **research and drafting stages** of legislation; final decisions remain with government authorities (e.g., Parliament).

## The Finnish Case Study: Off-Road Traffic Law Reform

### Background

- **Subject:** Reform of Finland's off-road traffic law, which regulates motor-powered transportation in the countryside (snowmobiles, ATVs).
- **Original law:** Enacted in 1995; a 2010 reform bill expired in Parliament due to controversy.
- **Crowdsourcing initiative:** Launched by the Finnish Ministry of Environment and the Committee for the Future in the Finnish Parliament in 2013.
- **Goals:** Gather knowledge and ideas from the public, enhance understanding of the law, and increase perceptions of policy legitimacy.

### Crowdsourcing Process

- **Platform:** An online platform where participants could:
  - Propose ideas.
  - Vote ideas up or down (thumbs up/down).
  - Comment on ideas.
- **Participation:**
  - Registration required (anonymous, real name, or nickname allowed).
  - Accessible to registered and non-registered visitors.
- **Two Phases:**
  1. **Phase 1:** Civil servants defined main areas for problem identification (e.g., age limits, emissions standards, route establishment).
  2. **Phase 2:** Participants could propose their own topics outside the provided framework.
- **Output:** ~500 ideas, ~4,000 comments, ~24,000 up/down votes from ~700 registered users.

## Research Methods

- **Action Research & Participant-Observation:** The researchers participated in design and moderation of the platform.
- **Digital Ethnography (Netnography):** Daily observations (30 min–1 hour/day for 153 days) documented interactions and turning points.
- **Interviews:** 40 semi-structured interviews with 29 individuals (21 online participants, civil servants, politicians, interest group members). Average interview length: 57 minutes.
- **Online Survey:** 186 completed responses (25% response rate) examining demographics, perceptions, and experiences with crowdsourcing in democracy.

## Key Findings

### 1. Democratic Deliberation Did Emerge

Despite the crowdsourcing process being designed for **knowledge and idea gathering**, not deliberation, the researchers found that **democratic deliberation emerged organically**.

#### Evidence of Deliberation:

- Participants **exchanged arguments** in a dialogical, intersubjective manner.
- Exchanges displayed elements of:
  - **Judicious arguments** and **careful examination** of issues.
  - **Identification of possible solutions**.
  - **Critical listening** (though this was the weakest dimension—56% of respondents felt participants did *not* make a strong effort to hear others).
- Arguments often took the form of **personal stories and anecdotes**.

#### Example 1: Age Limits for Snowmobiles and Tractors
- Participants debated whether age limits were necessary.
- Arguments included personal experiences (e.g., teaching children to drive safely), counter-examples (reckless 16-year-olds), and conceptual distinctions (recreational vs. professional use, type of vehicle).
- The thread displayed **five distinct arguments** that built upon each other, with a respectful tone.

#### Example 2: Need-Based vs. Rights-Based Route Creation
- Debate over whether new snowmobile routes should be created based on demonstrated need or based on snowmobilers' rights to free movement.
- Participants introduced legal and ethical arguments, including references to the **European Human Rights Agreement**.
- Despite some irritation, participants made genuine efforts to understand complex positions.

### 2. Unique Features of Crowdsourced Deliberation

- **Depersonalized and Asynchronous:** Deliberation occurred between **viewpoints** rather than specific individuals; anyone could join a thread and take up or attack a view.
- **Distributed and Fluid:** Conversations could continue over days, weeks, or months, with comments arriving at various times.
- **No Clear Leader or Authority Figure:** 60% of surveyed participants perceived contributors spoke with an equal degree of authority.

### 3. Freedom, Equality, and Publicity

- **Freedom:** Finland is among the world's freest and most digitally connected countries (90% Internet access). Participation was voluntary and self-selected.
- **Equality:** Participants perceived their experience as broadly democratic and egalitarian. No dominant leader emerged.
- **Publicity (Horizontal Transparency):** All exchanges were visible to the community, ensuring accountability and encouraging civility.

### 4. Civility and Respect

- Only ~20 comments were removed for inappropriate tone (out of ~4,000).
- 51% of respondents perceived other participants as sincere.
- 51% perceived the overall tone as civil and respectful (33% saw exchanges as lacking civility).
- Strong opinions were common (64% held strong opinions), yet the level of civility **exceeded expectations**.

### 5. Critical Listening Was the Weakest Dimension

- 56% of respondents felt participants did *not* make a strong effort to hear and understand others' viewpoints.
- Explanation: Online interactions tend to encourage rapid expression of views rather than careful acknowledgment of others' comments.
- **Design Implication:** Future platforms could be designed to explicitly foster listening and responsiveness.

## The Representativeness Objection

### The Problem

- Participants were **not statistically representative** of the larger Finnish population:
  - Over 80% male.
  - Mostly educated and politically somewhat active.
  - 72% had expressed views on online forums before.

### The Authors' Response

1. **No democratic innovation is ever perfectly representative.** All participatory processes involve some element of self-selection.
2. **Equality of opportunity to participate matters more than statistical representativeness.** Everyone had an equal right to join; not everyone chose to.
3. **Passive participants may feel represented by active ones.** Some interviewees noted that when their concerns were already voiced, they chose not to add more.
4. **Issue representativeness was high.** Interviews indicated that a diverse array of opinions were represented, even if demographic diversity was lacking.
5. **Crowdsourcing is not direct decision-making.** The crowd provides input; final decisions rest with elected representatives and civil servants, who can correct for skew.
6. **Representativeness should be judged at the systemic level,** not the level of individual participatory experiments.

## Crowdsourced Deliberation: A New Concept

The authors introduce the term **"crowdsourced deliberation"** to describe a unique type of deliberation characterized by:

1. **Self-selected participants** (distinct from randomly selected or organizer-chosen participants).
2. **Embedding in a larger process** whose outcome is determined by authorities distinct from the crowd (e.g., government officials).
3. **Open, asynchronous, depersonalized, and distributed** nature.
4. **Can be intentional or emergent** (as in this case, where deliberation emerged despite not being the primary design goal).

When such deliberation meets the criteria of democratic deliberation (free, equal, public exchange of arguments), it becomes **"crowdsourced democratic deliberation."**

## Implications and Future Directions

### Key Implications

- **Crowdsourcing for policymaking can foster democratic deliberation**, even when not explicitly designed to do so.
- **If properly incentivized and rewarded**, the quantity and quality of crowdsourced deliberation would likely increase.
- **Crowdsourced deliberation has potential for mass deliberation** because of its open, asynchronous, and depersonalized nature—unlike mini-publics, which are limited in scale.
- **Compared to traditional lawmaking** (which relies on civil servants and interest groups), crowdsourced lawmaking is **more inclusive**, allowing ordinary citizens to contribute fresh ideas.

### Future Research Questions

- What is the **quality and quantity** of deliberation fostered in crowdsourcing?
- Does crowdsourcing lead to **peer-learning, preference-transformation, and consensus building**?
- Can crowdsourcing be **scaled up** to hundreds of thousands of participants using natural language processing and innovative technologies?

### Limitations

- Single-country, single-issue case study.
- Future research should replicate in other countries and on other issues.

## Conclusion

The Finnish off-road traffic law crowdsourcing experiment demonstrates that **crowdsourcing in policymaking can serve as a space for democratic deliberation**, even when deliberation is not a primary design objective. The process enabled citizens to exchange reasoned arguments in a free, equal, and public manner, contributing to both the **epistemic quality** (generating useful ideas) and the **legitimacy** of the policy process.

While challenges remain—particularly around representativeness and fostering critical listening—the study suggests that **crowdsourced democratic deliberation** is a viable and scalable innovation for opening up governance and engaging citizens in meaningful policy dialogue.
